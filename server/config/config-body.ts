// Which fields of a POST /api/config body are the wrong SHAPE — the check that decides
// between a 400 and a merge.
//
// Kept pure and separate from the route because the route module reads the user's real
// config file at import time, so the rule could not otherwise be tested without touching
// the developer's home directory.
//
// Why shape is checked before merging at all: the merge treats "present" as "replace", and
// every sanitizer answers a non-array with an empty array. So a body like
// `{"providers": {}}` would not fail — it would silently WIPE the saved providers. The
// guard exists so a malformed field is rejected instead of applied as a deletion.
