// Moved out of index.ts (#548): a table of ~40 mount calls is a list of what exists, not a
// decision, and reading index.ts should not mean scrolling past it to reach the parts that
// do decide something. The ORDER still matters and is preserved exactly — the plugin tool
// routes must precede mountAllRoutes' /api/plugin/:toolName catch-all, and the SPA fallback
// must come after the static mount.
//
// What arrives as deps is what index.ts owns: the spawners, the session lifecycle, the title
// manager, the tool stores, and `publish` (pub/sub exists only once the HTTP server does).
