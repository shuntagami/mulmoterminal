# MulmoTerminal

**English** · [日本語](README.ja.md) · [简体中文](README.zh.md) · [繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md) · [한국어](README.ko.md)

**Run multiple coding-agent sessions in parallel — and see which one needs you.**

A **browser terminal** for **parallel AI coding agents**: several sessions side by side, each in
its own cell, with the one that needs you marked in colour. **Claude Code** is the default and six
more CLIs are first-class — Codex, Antigravity, Grok, Muse, GitHub Copilot CLI and Cursor CLI. Vibe
coding with a single agent needs nothing but a shell — this is for when you run several and lose
track of which is waiting. Sessions survive a reload (tmux), work isolates in **git worktrees**,
and a **phone push** reaches you when a turn finishes.

**Every cell is a real pty.** `htop`, `lazygit`, a dev server and Claude Code are the same kind
of object here — which is why the one-session-per-worktree limit applies to **agents only**, and
a shell or a `yarn dev` launcher can sit in the same worktree an agent is working in.

## Demo

![MulmoTerminal — a grid of live Claude Code sessions, each color-coded by state, updating in real time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/receptron/mulmoterminal/main/docs/guide/images/hero.gif)

*The grid, live — each cell coloured **working**, **done** or **needs you**.*

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b8dd582-6c0d-4be3-b0b4-3740ad0bdba6

*90 seconds, with sound: one agent, then a grid of them. Zoom into one and the roster still holds what every other session asked, answered and did, so you go to whichever is lit and lose nothing catching up.*

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Transcript of the narration</summary>

When you ran one coding agent, the slowest thing in the room was the agent.

Now that you run five, the slowest thing in the room is probably you.

One of them is always stopped. A permission prompt. A question. Until you notice, it does nothing at all.

MulmoTerminal puts every session on one screen. Blue is working. Green is done. Amber is waiting on you.

You stop hunting. You go where the light is.

The other kind of slow is: what did I even ask this one? The roster keeps one line per session — what you asked, and what came back. Nothing left to remember.

When one is done, you don't go looking for its window. Click its row — the next order goes in right there.

Then you pick the next one from whatever is lit. Click, answer, move on. You never go looking — the roster tells you.

We built MulmoTerminal for exactly that: not to watch agents, but to triage them.

That is the whole install.

</details>

MulmoTerminal turns [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) — and six other agent CLIs —
into a parallel, observable workspace: many agent sessions at once in a grid, each one
color-coded so you see at a glance which are **working**, which **need you**, and which are
**done** — plus rich GUI output, git worktrees with one-click PRs, cost readouts, and a
ping to your phone when a task finishes. One `npx` command, no Electron, no config.

```bash
npx mulmoterminal@latest        # starts on http://localhost:34567 and opens your browser
```

Requires **Node ≥ 22.12**, and by default the [`claude`](https://claude.com/claude-code) CLI —
on your `PATH` or named by `CLAUDE_BIN`, already logged in. Declare a different default agent
(`--agent codex`, or `"defaultAgent"` in `~/.mulmoterminal/config.json`) and start-up checks that
one instead. `npx mulmoterminal@latest init` reports what it can't find. On an older Node it stops
before starting the server, with a banner and the upgrade commands for however that Node was
installed.

### Why not tmux + iTerm panes?

Running agents in parallel was never the hard part — tmux does that fine. What gets lost
is **which** of them is waiting for you. A pane is opaque: working, finished and
blocked-on-a-permission all look the same until you read it. Here every cell reports its
state back to one grid — working (blue), done (green), **needs you** (amber) — with a chime
when one goes amber off-screen, and a [cockpit roster](#why-youll-want-it) of one line per
session so you can answer one without losing your place in the other four. It runs *on*
tmux when you have it, for [persistence across restarts](#session-persistence-tmux).

Built by **[receptron](https://github.com/receptron)** — **[Satoshi Nakajima](https://x.com/snakajima)**,
software architect for **Windows 95** at Microsoft, and **[Isamu Arimoto](https://github.com/isamu)**;
the same two behind **[GraphAI](https://github.com/receptron/graphai)**. [More ↓](#who-builds-this)

## Why you'll want it

- **See every agent at once.** A grid of live sessions, each cell color-coded by state —
  **working** (blue), **blocked / needs a permission** (amber), **done, unreviewed** (blue),
  **idle** — with an attention chime and a toolbar tally, so an off-screen agent that's stuck
  never slips past you. Stop babysitting one terminal; supervise ten. Zoom into one and the
  **cockpit roster** keeps everyone else in view — one text row per session with its AI
  summary, last prompt, latest reply, and the branch's **PR phase** (draft / CI fail /
  ready / merged).
- **A GUI for your agents, not just a terminal.** Beside the terminal, a **Canvas** panel
  renders what an agent produces over MCP — **documents, forms, charts, generated images,
  HTML, collection cards** — each drawn by its own plugin. The agent doesn't just print
  text; it hands you an interface.
- **Get pulled back from anywhere.** A finished — or input-waiting — task sends a **Web Push
  to your phone**, and the **RemoteHost** companion lets you watch sessions and answer with a
  tap (**yes / no / continue**) from the phone itself — walk away, get pinged, jump back in.
- **Nothing is lost on a restart.** With `tmux`, every session survives a server crash,
  restart, or `node --watch` reload — a mid-turn agent, a long build, a dev server all keep
  running and reattach when you come back. A crashed server is restarted for you, so the
  tab you left open finds it again.
- **Ship without leaving the grid.** Each repo cell shows a **git branch chip**, isolates
  work in a one-click **git worktree**, opens a **diff** panel, and does **commit / push /
  open PR** — so several agents can work the same repo without colliding.
- **Know what it's costing.** Per-session **context %**, **token**, and **estimated $**
  readouts, an **activity timeline** of tool calls, and **AI-summarized** cell titles and
  command-output explanations — so a wall of parallel agents stays legible.
- **Make it yours.** Per-directory **themes, colors, and name badges** (`prod` in red,
  `staging` in amber), a configurable header (buttons + info chips), custom attention sounds,
  and Run / Skill / Mulmo menus to launch a project's scripts, `.claude/skills` and decks right
  inside a cell.

![MulmoTerminal's grid view — four live Claude sessions running side by side, each in its own color-coded project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/receptron/mulmoterminal/main/docs/guide/images/grid-2x2-live.png)

*The grid is a **cockpit for parallel agents** — here, four live Claude sessions, each in its own color-coded project. Every cell's header carries what you need to triage at a glance: **model · context %**, **token counts** (`⇡in ⇣out`), the **git branch / changes** chip, and an AI summary of what the agent is doing. A cell's **border color signals state** — working (blue), done (green), needs-you (amber — e.g. waiting on a permission), idle — with an attention chime so a stuck cell off-screen still pulls you back. Supervise many; only step in where you're called.*

![The cockpit roster — a one-row-per-session summary list beside the enlarged terminal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/receptron/mulmoterminal/main/docs/guide/images/cockpit-roster.png)

*Zoomed in, the **cockpit roster** replaces thumbnails with information: every session as a
text row — directory, AI summary, your last prompt, the agent's latest reply, a status word,
and the branch's **PR phase** badge. A row whose agent is **waiting on you** rings amber and
blinks; one that has merely **finished** rings green and stays still (Settings → Waiting rows
turns the movement off). Click a row to swap the enlarged terminal.*

### What it is, under the hood

Each session runs as a real PTY on the server (the agent CLI in a pseudo-terminal) and is
streamed to an [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) terminal in the browser over a WebSocket. The
**cockpit roster** lists every session and reflects, in real time, which are **working**
(the agent is thinking, a spinner), which are **waiting on you** (a permission prompt or a
question — an amber dot; nothing proceeds until you answer) and which are **finished with output
you haven't seen** (a green dot) — driven by the activity each agent reports; claude's hooks are injected per
spawn. The horizontal tab bar carries the same two dots.

![One agent zoomed, with the GUI panel beside it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/receptron/mulmoterminal/main/docs/guide/images/zoom-canvas.png)

*To focus on one agent, **zoom its cell**: it takes the window, and the **GUI panel** ("Canvas") opens beside it, where that agent's tool calls render as documents, forms, charts, images, and HTML rather than printed text. **The app opens on the grid** (`/`, settling on `/terminals`), which is the only view; 3.x had a separate single view at `/chat` and 4.0.0 removed it, so that URL now lands on the grid like any other.*

**Inserting a file path** — like a native terminal, you can put a file's absolute path into
the prompt: **drag a file** onto the terminal, or click the **file button** in the terminal
header, which asks the local server to open the OS file dialog and inserts the chosen path. The
path is inserted at the cursor — it is not submitted, so you can review it first.

A drag inserts the file's **own** path where the browser exposes one via `file://`
(Firefox/Safari), so editing it afterwards edits the file you dropped. Where the browser
withholds it — **Chrome**, and every browser when MulmoTerminal is open **from another
machine**, where a local path would name nothing on the host — the file's bytes are sent
instead, saved to a private per-session directory under the OS temp dir, and *that* path is
inserted. The session is granted that directory at launch (Claude Code's `--add-dir`), so the agent reads it without a permission prompt; the copies are removed
when the session ends, and any left by a crash are swept at the next start. Up to 110 MiB per
file — the same ceiling as a phone attachment. **A session already running when you upgrade
was launched without that grant**, so drops into it still prompt; new sessions don't.

**Pasting a screenshot** — take a screenshot and paste it straight into the terminal
(`Cmd`/`Ctrl`+`V`). The image is saved to the session's own drop directory — the same place a
dropped file goes, with the same grant, the same 110 MiB ceiling and the same cleanup when the
session ends — and its **absolute path** is inserted at the cursor, so the agent can read it.
Unlike a drop, this does not need the browser to expose a path — the bytes are on the
clipboard — so it also covers Chrome, where dropping a file cannot insert a path. It works
wherever the browser puts the image on the clipboard as `image/png`, `image/jpeg`,
`image/gif`, or `image/webp`. Anything else is left to the terminal's own paste handling,
exactly as before — including a paste that carries **plain text** next to the image, which
copying from a web page usually does, so that pasting text keeps working.

<a id="clicking-a-file-path"></a>

**Clicking a file path** — the other direction. A path an agent *prints* becomes a link, and
**what it opens is chosen by its extension**, so each kind arrives as the thing it is rather
than as bytes (files within the session's working directory only):

| A clicked … | opens as |
|---|---|
| `.md` `.markdown` | **rendered** markdown in a new tab — the same sandboxed `…/md` HTML the Files preview renders, minus the one script the preview needs to report where you are reading. It follows your system light/dark setting, since under the sandbox CSP it can't ask the app which theme is on |
| `.json` | **indented** in a new tab (Chrome and Safari otherwise show one long line) |
| `.csv` `.tsv` | a **table** in a new tab, with a sticky header that scrolls inside its own box |
| source, config, logs, and `.txt` — 46 extensions | the app's own **Files** view (`/files?path=`), where CodeMirror highlights it, the tree is right there, and it can be edited |
| `.html` `.htm` | the **rendered page** in a new tab, under the same sandboxed policy as the Files pane's Preview: its scripts run at an opaque origin with no fetch or XHR (so they cannot reach the app or its API), and an image beside it loads by its relative path (a relative stylesheet or script does not). The raw route answers `.html` as plain text, so opening one there showed its source |
| images, PDF, SVG, video, audio | raw bytes in a new tab, which the browser renders better than an editor would |
| everything else — `.xlsx`, `.docx`, `.zip`, a `Makefile` | the app's own **Files** view. A tab cannot display these, so opening one there is not a view — it is a download starting with no warning. The pane names the file and offers **Open in OS**, which hands it to the application that owns it (Excel for an `.xlsx`) |

**A line after the path is followed.** `src/a.ts:42`, `src/a.ts:42:7` (gcc, clang, `eslint -f unix`,
stack traces) and `src/a.ts(12,5)` (tsc) are one link. In the pane, and in the Files view, the file
opens as text with the caret on that line and column — an HTML page, an SVG or a table included, and a
tab reading in Preview switches to Edit. An image, a PDF, a video or an audio file has no line to go
to and simply opens as itself. A route that renders the file in a new tab (`.md`, `.json`,
`.csv`, `.html` with no cell enlarged) ignores the line. When the pane beside an enlarged cell takes
the click, the keyboard stays in the terminal; the full-screen Files view, with no terminal beside it,
puts it in the editor. (ESLint's default output puts the path on a line of its own, with no line number to follow.)

**While a grid cell is enlarged, the [Files pane](#files-view-browse--edit) takes the click first** — every
row above, since the pane is the same editor with a Preview for Markdown, HTML and SVG, shows an
image as a picture and a PDF in a frame, and plays a video or an audio file with the browser's own
controls (seeking included, whatever the file's size). The file opens *beside* the terminal
that printed it, and the pane opens itself if it was closed. It declines, leaving the routing
above untouched, when nothing is enlarged, or when the path is not under that cell's own directory
(the pane cannot walk above its root). A file too large to edit as text still offers **Open in OS**.

Highlighting in the Files view covers the JS/TS family, JSON and Markdown (the modes
`cmEditor.ts` bundles); other languages open as plain text.

This set is **deliberately asymmetric** with the set the server serves as viewable text —
`.md` goes to the rendered viewer rather than the Files view, `.txt` does the opposite, and
dotfiles are server-only. The 45 extensions both sides agree on live in
`common/sourceExtensions.ts`, each side adds its own extras, and
`test/common/sourceExtensions.spec.ts` pins the asymmetry so it isn't "fixed" into symmetry.

> **Changing this?** The routing table is `ROUTE_BY_EXTENSION` / `IN_APP_EXTENSIONS` in
> `src/composables/terminalFilePathLinkProvider.ts`. Update this section, the
> `docs/guide/{en,ja}/features.md` row, and the link table in `docs/terminal-notes.md`
> together — all three went stale once already (#834).

## What people say after switching

> These are experiences reported by users who moved over from an IDE or a split terminal —
> not benchmarks, and not claims we measured. Your setup may differ.

### "It stopped eating my memory"

Keeping several agents apart by opening several IDE windows is expensive: each one brings its own
editor, language server, extensions and file watchers. One user reported a **64 GB machine
stuttering** under that load, and running smoothly after moving over — here the agents are PTYs on
a server and the UI is browser tabs.

### "I stopped answering the wrong agent"

Six panes of scrolling text look identical. Users have described **typing a reply into another
agent's terminal**, and losing track of what they had asked in the first place. As one put it, the
windows all look the same, so switching between them costs time just to work out what you are
looking at.

The problem isn't attention — it's that N identical panes means holding N contexts in your head.
Colour-coded state, a name badge and a per-directory colour move that onto the screen instead.

### "Watching many and reading one stopped being a trade-off"

Splitting a terminal six ways leaves every pane too small to read a long answer without constant
scrolling and resizing — one user described exactly that with a 4,000-character reply. So you
quietly accept worse reading every time you add an agent.

**Grid ↔ enlarge removes that.** Watch all of them, then blow one up and read it properly — the
cockpit roster keeps the rest in view as text while you do.

### "My existing sessions came with me"

Sessions resume as-is — same `claude --resume`, same transcripts. Point it at a directory you
already work in and your history is there. Nothing to migrate, nothing to redo. One user said this
alone made the switch worth it, having previously lost context to killed sessions.

---

**You don't need ten agents for this to pay off.** Users have reported the switch being worth it at
**one to three** parallel sessions. The wins above are about not losing track, not about running
more.

## Install & run

Needs **Node ≥ 22.12**, plus these CLIs — on your `PATH`, or named by the matching `<AGENT>_BIN`:

> **Never installed any of this before?** The guide walks it end to end, macOS and Windows,

> [はじめに — 起動するまで](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/ja/getting-started.html)

| | Tool | What it gives you | Install |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Required** *(unless you declare another)* | [`claude`](https://claude.com/claude-code) | every Claude session — this app is a cockpit for it. Start-up requires it **by default**; declare a default agent and it checks that one instead — `npx mulmoterminal --agent codex`, or `"defaultAgent": "codex"` in `~/.mulmoterminal/config.json` (#2082). `CLAUDE_BIN` is honoured, so an install off `PATH` counts | `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, then run `claude` once to log in |
| **Required** | `git` | [worktree isolation](#git-worktrees--pull-requests), each cell's branch / unsaved-dot / diff readout, the PR footer | `brew install git` · `sudo apt install git` · `sudo dnf install git` · Windows: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) |
| **Required** | `gh` | the cross-repo **PRs & Issues** view and one-click PR creation — it uses your `gh` login, so no token is stored | [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com), then `gh auth login` |
| Optional | `glab` | the same for **GitLab** projects (#981) — gitlab.com, and a self-hosted instance you declare in `gitlabHosts` (#1332). Same arrangement: the CLI holds the credentials, this app stores no token | `brew install glab`, then `glab auth login` (self-hosted: `glab auth login --hostname gitlab.example.com`) |
| Recommended | `tmux` | [session persistence](#session-persistence-tmux) — terminals survive a server restart | `brew install tmux` · `sudo apt install tmux` · `sudo dnf install tmux` · no native Windows build (falls back to plain PTYs) |
| Optional | any other agent CLI | a cell can run **Codex**, **Antigravity** (`agy`), **Grok**, **Muse**, **GitHub Copilot CLI** or **Cursor CLI** instead of Claude — install only the ones you use, and a missing one simply fails to start that cell. What each can do is [the capability matrix](docs/agent-capability-matrix.md); how to install and pick one is the [agents guide](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/agents.html) | e.g. `npm i -g @openai/codex` |
| Optional | `ffmpeg` | video rendering from the [mulmo-script panel](#wiki-collections--the-gui-panel) (its plugin ships enabled) | `brew install ffmpeg` · `sudo apt install ffmpeg` · `sudo dnf install ffmpeg` |
| Optional | `ollama` | [`claude-ollama`](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/claude-ollama.html) — Claude Code against a fully local model | [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download) |
| Linux only | a file dialog | the launcher's **Choose a folder** button and the path menu's **Insert a file path**, which open an OS dialog on the machine the server runs on. macOS and Windows have one built in; **WSL** uses the Windows one over interop and needs nothing installed. A Linux desktop needs one of these — without any, they say so and you type the path instead (#1447) | `sudo apt install zenity` · `sudo dnf install zenity` · `kdialog`, `qarma` and `yad` also work |

The server starts without any of the non-required rows; you just lose that row's feature,
and the header/panel for it says so. `git` and `gh` are marked required because losing them
costs whole views rather than one button. `claude` is required only until you name a different
default agent — see
[Starting without Claude Code](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/agents.html#default-agent)
· [日本語](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/ja/agents.html#default-agent). `npx mulmoterminal@latest init` (below) reports which of
these it can find.

```bash
npx mulmoterminal@latest           # start on http://localhost:34567 and open the browser
# or install globally:
npm install -g mulmoterminal
mulmoterminal
```

**Stopping it.** `Ctrl+C` in the terminal that started it — or, if you can no longer find that
terminal, **Settings → Quit MulmoTerminal** in the browser, or **`npx mulmoterminal@latest stop`**
from any terminal (installed globally, just `mulmoterminal stop`; it stops every server running on
this machine, and `--port <port>` stops only that one). All three run the same shutdown:
with `tmux` installed the agent sessions survive and come back under **Settings → Sessions that
survived a restart**; without it they end with the server.

**First-run setup (optional).** `npx mulmoterminal@latest init` checks your environment (Node ≥ 22.12
and every CLI in the table above), says how to update when Node is behind the latest LTS of its line
or Claude Code is behind its `stable` release, seeds the launcher's **directory
presets** from the projects in your Claude Code history, and writes `~/.mulmoterminal/config.json`.
It's **idempotent** — re-run it any time to refresh the presets; it overwrites the managed parts
and keeps your other settings. When `claude` is installed it can hand off to the
`/mulmoterminal-config` skill for interactive tweaks — it routes to the one that owns what you
want to change. Once the app is up you can also reach them from **Settings**: each section that a
skill can write ends in a button that starts that skill in a new session, which is how the settings
with no UI (a theme of your own, `keymap`) get written without hand-editing JSON.

**Google account (optional).** Link a Google account to enable the chat's `google` tool and the
phone's `google.calendar.*` commands: read/create events on any calendar (not just your primary),
list the calendars you've subscribed to, and read the colour palettes. Sign in from
**Settings → Google account**, or run `npx mulmoterminal@latest google login` — the CLI is the fallback
for when you're driving MulmoTerminal from another machine, since consent finishes on a loopback
listener and needs a browser **on the host**. Either way it needs a Desktop OAuth client JSON saved
as `~/.secrets/client_secret_*.json`; the refresh token lands in `~/.config/mulmo/google-token.json`
and is **shared with MulmoClaude**, so one link per machine covers both apps.

**Local models (optional).** The package also ships `claude-ollama` — a one-command launcher that
runs Claude Code **fully locally against an [Ollama](https://ollama.com) model** (no cloud, no API
key). It starts a large-context Ollama server and launches `claude` with a minimal system prompt so
small models aren't drowned:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:4b
npx -p mulmoterminal claude-ollama qwen3:4b   # or, if installed globally: claude-ollama qwen3:4b
```

See [Local models with claude-ollama](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/claude-ollama.html)
for the details and model notes.

> **Already linked before the calendar-list / colour features?** They need a read scope your existing
> link doesn't have, so `listCalendars` (and, in practice, `colors`) fail with an insufficient-scope
> 403 until you re-authorize: **Settings → Google account → Unlink**, then sign in again (or re-run
> `google login`). Reading/creating events on your primary calendar keeps working without re-linking.

A global install isn't auto-updated, so on startup MulmoTerminal checks npm and
prints a one-line notice when a newer version is available — and the web toolbar shows a
clickable **update badge** with the exact command for your install (`npm i -g mulmoterminal`,
or `git pull` for a clone). The server repeats that check every few hours, so a release that
ships while it is running still reaches the badge; the startup console notice is printed once
and is not repeated. Disable with `MULMOTERMINAL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` (or `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1`).

Options: `--cwd <dir>` (working directory — relative paths allowed; defaults to the
directory you run the command from), `--port <n>` (default 34567; the
`PORT` environment variable is used when the flag is absent), `--no-open`,
`--version`, `--help`.

```bash
npx mulmoterminal@latest --cwd ./my-project   # work in a specific directory
```

The published package ships the server (run via `tsx`) plus the pre-built web UI;
`npx mulmoterminal@latest` checks for the `claude` CLI — or for whichever agent you set as the
default — picks a free port, starts the server, and opens the browser. For local development from a clone, see
[Running](#running).

**Won't start with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`?** If a first `npx` run was interrupted, a half-unpacked `~/.npm/_npx/<hash>` cache can remain and a later run fails at startup — a corrupted npx cache, not a bug in the published package.
The launcher detects it and prints the exact, OS-appropriate removal command; run that, then `npx mulmoterminal@latest` again.

> helps you file one if none of that explains it, with the environment collected and secrets

```

- **Terminal I/O** flows over a raw WebSocket (`/ws`), one PTY per session.
- **Session list** is fetched over HTTP (`/api/sessions`) — by `App.vue` for the tab favicon,
  and by an empty cell's launch form (`?cwd=`) for its resume rows.
- **Live activity** is pushed over a Socket.IO pub/sub channel (`/ws/pubsub`);
  the server learns of activity from **hooks** that POST to `/api/hook`.
- **Other terminals** run on their own raw WebSockets — one per agent (`/ws/codex`,
  `/ws/antigravity`, `/ws/grok`, `/ws/muse`, `/ws/copilot`, `/ws/cursor`), persistent
  **launch commands** on `/ws/launch`, and one-off **script commands** (`yarn dev`, tests, …)
  on `/ws/run`. **Three agents reach `/api/hook`** — Claude directly, Copilot and Cursor through
  a translation of their own vocabularies; Codex is read from its rollout instead, and agy, grok
  and muse report no activity at all. Which agent does what is the matrix in
  [`docs/agent-capability-matrix.md`](docs/agent-capability-matrix.md); see also
  [Scripts (Run menu)](#scripts-run-menu).
- In dev (`yarn dev`) the Vite dev server runs on its own port (`CLIENT_PORT`,
  default `6856`) and proxies `/ws` (a prefix covering `/ws/codex`, `/ws/launch`, and
  `/ws/run`), `/ws/pubsub`, `/api`, `/artifacts`, and `/htmlfile` to the backend
  (`PORT`, default `34567`) — so you open the Vite port (e.g. `http://localhost:6856`).
  In production the backend serves the built client from `dist/` on `PORT`, and you open
  that.

## Why a PTY?

Claude Code's interactive mode renders its UI with [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink)
(a React-based TUI framework), which requires a real **TTY** to be attached. A
plain `child_process.spawn()` provides no TTY, so interactive Claude won't start
(it stays silent). [node-pty](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty) allocates a
real **pseudo-terminal** at the OS level, so from Claude's point of view it's
running in an ordinary terminal — full TUI rendering, cursor movement, colors,
and tool-approval prompts all work. We don't use `-p`/headless mode or the Agent
SDK; we drive the real interactive CLI and relay its TTY over the WebSocket.

> **macOS note:** node-pty's bundled `spawn-helper` binary ships without the
> execute bit (mode 644), which causes a `posix_spawnp failed` error. The
> `postinstall` script (`server/fix-pty-perms.js`) fixes it to 755 automatically.

## Agents: Claude, Codex, Antigravity, Grok, Muse, Copilot & Cursor

MulmoTerminal drives **interactive coding-agent CLIs**, not just Claude. An
`AgentAdapter` seam abstracts the per-agent bits (which binary to spawn, how it resumes)
so the PTY, grid, persistence, and GUI-panel plumbing stay shared. Seven adapters ship
today — **Claude Code** (the default), **Codex**, **Antigravity** (`agy`), **Grok**, **Muse**,
**GitHub Copilot CLI**, and **Cursor CLI**.
Which capabilities each one actually has — status dots, notifications, resume, cost, GUI tools —
is the matrix in [`docs/agent-capability-matrix.md`](docs/agent-capability-matrix.md).

- **Claude** — spawned as `claude` (override with `CLAUDE_BIN`). The server passes
  `--session-id <uuid>`, so it knows the live session's id even before its transcript
  file exists, and injects activity hooks per spawn (see
  [Claude hook injection](#claude-hook-injection)) plus the
  [closing summary](#closing-summary) instruction.
  The **whole** GUI MCP (`--mcp-config`, on one all-tools URL) goes only to a session that is not a grid cell, or to a grid cell whose cwd IS the workspace — `claimFullGuiMcp` in `server/session/registry.ts`, which is what gives a workspace cell the tools the single view had before 4.0.0 removed it. That equivalence is about what the session *carries*: a workspace cell is still a grid cell in every other respect. A cell in a project directory attaches none of ours, so its GUI tools come from whichever [Canvas switches](#wiki-collections--the-gui-panel) are registered for it. **Either way, Claude Code loads your own MCP servers normally** — the directory's local scope, any `.mcp.json` up the tree, your global ones and your claude.ai connectors. It did not always: `--strict-mcp-config` used to ride along with `--mcp-config`, which hid all of that from the very sessions meant to be the most capable ([#1338](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoterminal/issues/1338), [#1385](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoterminal/issues/1385)).
- **Codex** — spawned as `codex` (override with `CODEX_BIN`; `CODEX_MODEL` sets
  `--model`). Codex runs on its own WebSocket (`/ws/codex`) and its sessions appear in the
  cockpit roster next to Claude's. Because Codex only mints its rollout id **after** the first
  turn, the server watches `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` (home overridable via
  `CODEX_HOME`) and maps the new rollout to the session — attributed only when it's
  unambiguous, never by "newest wins". That mapping is appended to
  `~/.mulmoterminal/codex-rollouts.jsonl`, so a conversation is still resumable after the server
  restarts — without it a session whose tmux is also gone came back as a fresh codex. Resume
  reattaches a live PTY, adopts a surviving tmux session, or cold-resumes the rollout id.
- **Antigravity** — spawned as `agy` (override with `ANTIGRAVITY_BIN`; `ANTIGRAVITY_MODEL` sets
  `--model`). Antigravity runs on its own WebSocket (`/ws/antigravity`). Like Codex it mints its
  own conversation id, so the server watches `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/` (home overridable
  via `ANTIGRAVITY_HOME`) for the directory the new conversation creates — attributed only when
  unambiguous — and cold-resumes it with `--conversation <id>`. That mapping is appended to
  `~/.mulmoterminal/antigravity-conversations.jsonl`, so a conversation is still resumable after
  the server restarts — the same log Codex keeps, in the same format.

  Its **GUI tools work differently — in the workspace too**, because `agy` takes no MCP flag: it
  reads its servers from `.agents/mcp_config.json` in the working directory. So it never gets the
  workspace's "every tool automatically"; register what it needs with the Canvas switches, wherever
  it runs (see [MCP server ids](#mcp-server-ids-why-a-workspace-cell-and-a-project-cell-disagree)). MulmoTerminal writes that file from the
  directory's [Canvas switches](#wiki-collections--the-gui-panel) — the same switches Claude's cells read — so
  one switch serves every agent, and rewrites it whenever a switch flips or an agy session starts.
  Servers in it that MulmoTerminal did not write are left alone, the file is removed once no group
  is on, and it is kept out of your `git status` through `.git/info/exclude` — a local switch on a
  local machine, so it never reaches a diff or your team. The entry runs `server/mcp/bridge.mjs`, a stdio-to-HTTP shim onto the same in-process
  GUI MCP server the other agents call. The **session id is never written into that file** — it is
  per directory and shared by every session running there — and reaches the bridge through the agy
  process's own environment instead.

- **Grok** — spawned as `grok` (override with `GROK_BIN`; `GROK_MODEL` sets `--model`), on its own
  WebSocket (`/ws/grok`). It resumes the way **Claude** does rather than the way Codex and
  Antigravity do: `grok --session-id <uuid>` starts a conversation under an id MulmoTerminal minted,
  so there is no watcher, no attribution guess, and no mapping log — the id the browser holds is
  grok's own. A reconnect passes `--resume <id>` instead, but only once a conversation by that name
  exists on disk: grok writes one under `~/.grok/sessions/<url-encoded cwd>/<id>/` (home overridable
  via `GROK_HOME`) after the first turn, and re-using a `--session-id` that already exists is a hard
  error, which is why the two flags are never sent together.

  Its **GUI tools work like Antigravity's — in the workspace too** and for the same reason: `grok`
  takes no MCP flag, so it never gets the workspace's "every tool automatically" either, and
  MulmoTerminal registers the bridge in `.grok/config.toml` (grok's project-scope config) from the
  directory's [Canvas switches](#wiki-collections--the-gui-panel), wherever it runs (see
  [MCP server ids](#mcp-server-ids-why-a-workspace-cell-and-a-project-cell-disagree)). That file is TOML and yours, so —
  unlike agy's JSON — MulmoTerminal never rewrites it directly: it drives `grok mcp add -s project` /
  `grok mcp remove -s project`, and only for the server ids it wrote itself. Nothing else in the file
  is touched, a directory already in the right state runs no command at all, and the file is added to
  `.git/info/exclude` only when MulmoTerminal created it. As with agy, the **session id is never
  written into that file** — it reaches the bridge through the grok process's own environment.

- **Muse** — spawned as `muse` (override with `MUSE_BIN`; `MUSE_MODEL` sets `--model`), on its own
  WebSocket (`/ws/muse`). It is codex-shaped on the id axis — it mints its own session id as a row
  in `session-index.db`, so a fresh spawn is watched for the new row and a reconnect resumes it with
  `muse resume <id>`. That resume also carries `--workspace <dir>`: the flag is what registers the
  policy-gated workspace tools, so a resumed session without it comes back with the conversation and
  without the tools. Sessions run under `--yolo`, because an unattended grid cell needs an
  approval-free mode — it has no way to answer a modal prompt in a TUI nobody is watching. (Codex
  is the exception that proves it: it is passed no such mode, so it can still block on its own
  approval prompt.) Its GUI tools reach
  it a third way, through an installed **plugin** rather than a flag or a directory file; see
  [MCP server ids](#mcp-server-ids-why-a-workspace-cell-and-a-project-cell-disagree).

- **GitHub Copilot CLI** — spawned as `copilot` (override with `COPILOT_BIN`; `COPILOT_MODEL` sets
  `--model`), on its own WebSocket (`/ws/copilot`). It is the **simplest** adapter here, because one
  flag does what the others split in two: `--session-id <uuid>` sets the UUID for a NEW session *and*
  resumes that same session later, so MulmoTerminal mints the id and there is no watcher, no
  attribution guess and no mapping log. Sessions land in `~/.copilot/session-state/<id>/` with a
  machine-wide index at `~/.copilot/session-store.db` (home overridable via `COPILOT_HOME`), which is
  what `/api/copilot/sessions` queries by working directory.

  **Its status dots, attention sound and tool history come from copilot's own hooks**, the way
  Claude's do — but registered **once per machine**, not per spawn: MulmoTerminal writes
  `<COPILOT_HOME>/hooks/mulmoterminal.json`, and every hook payload carries the `sessionId` that is
  already ours. Copilot has no `--settings` equivalent, and its documented per-directory hook files
  do not load. Three things follow. A copilot session **you** start in a plain terminal also posts
  to MulmoTerminal (its id is unknown, so the server ignores it — and the hook is written to fail
  silently and quickly). **Two MulmoTerminal instances on different ports share that one file**, so
  the last one to start wins and the other's copilot cells run without status until their next
  spawn — an accepted limitation, logged when it happens, not something that can be fixed without
  either refusing a second instance or adding a machine-wide daemon. And the file is **removed when
  the server exits**, with a stale one left by a crash reaped at the next startup: it names a bare
  `127.0.0.1:<port>`, so a leftover would point copilot's prompts at whatever took that port next.

  `--allow-all-tools` is passed for the reason every agent here needs one: a grid cell cannot answer
  a modal prompt. The **whole GUI MCP** reaches a workspace cell through `--additional-mcp-config`,
  the same per-spawn shape Claude's `--mcp-config` has; a project cell gets the groups its directory
  registered. What it does **not** do yet: report being blocked on input (`permissionRequest` fires
  on every tool call, not only when someone is asked), token/context badges, or `$` cost — see
  [`docs/agent-capability-matrix.md`](docs/agent-capability-matrix.md) for what each would take.

- **Cursor CLI** — spawned as `cursor-agent` (override with `CURSOR_BIN`; `CURSOR_MODEL` sets
  `--model`), on its own WebSocket (`/ws/cursor`). Identity works exactly as copilot's does: one
  flag, `--resume <uuid>`, both starts a chat under an id MulmoTerminal invented and returns to it
  later, so there is no watcher, no attribution guess and no mapping log. `--trust` is passed as well
  as `--force`, because a directory Cursor has not seen before otherwise blocks on a Workspace Trust
  prompt nobody is watching. Chats land under `~/.cursor/projects/<slug>/agent-transcripts/<id>/`,
  where `<slug>` is a truncated-and-hashed form of the directory that cannot be reconstructed — so
  `/api/cursor/sessions` reads each project directory's own `.workspace-trusted` to learn which
  directory it stands for, and omits any that does not say.

  **Its status dots and tool history come from cursor's own hooks**, registered **once per machine**
  in `~/.cursor/hooks.json` — cursor has no `--settings` equivalent, and `--plugin-dir`, which would
  have been one, does not deliver hooks to the interactive TUI. That file is a FIXED path, so a user
  who already keeps their own hooks there is left alone (with a line in the log) rather than merged
  into. It is removed when the server exits, and a stale one left by a crash is rewritten at the next
  startup. Two MulmoTerminal instances share it with the same accepted limitation copilot's has.

  Cursor is the only agent besides Claude that drives **both** status halves — `beforeSubmitPrompt`
  starts the turn and `stop` ends it. What it does **not** do: report being blocked on input (every
  event that fires before an approval prompt also fires when nothing is asked), the GUI MCP (cursor
  reads MCP from a file and no writer ships yet), token/context badges (the `stop` payload carries
  the counts, unread), or `$` cost — see
  [`docs/agent-capability-matrix.md`](docs/agent-capability-matrix.md) for what each would take.

**Choosing an agent.** Each grid cell's launch form carries the **Agent Picker** — a
**Claude / Codex / Antigravity / Grok / Muse / Copilot / Cursor / Shell** toggle — and the Collections
browser a **Claude / Codex / Antigravity / Grok / Muse / Copilot / Cursor** one (your choice is
remembered).
**Shell** is not an agent: it runs your OS default shell (`$SHELL`, or `/bin/sh`) in the
chosen directory, with nothing to install and nothing to configure. It starts a launcher
cell, so it has no model, no MCP registration, and no worktree — those rows disappear
while it is picked.

**Other models.**
Claude Code can run against any **Anthropic-compatible** backend (OpenRouter, Moonshot, a
LiteLLM gateway). Backends are listed in `~/.mulmoterminal/config.json` under `providers`,
and their **keys are read from the server's environment** — never from a file the app
serves. A directory sets its default in `.mulmoterminal.json` (`provider` / `model`), and
each grid cell's launch form has a **MODEL** select that overrides it for one session,
listing ~27 curated models with the measured pass rate of a real tool-using task beside
each. A provider whose token can't be resolved **refuses to start** rather than falling
back to Anthropic. Full walkthrough — setup, the measured model list, adding your own models, troubleshooting:
[Using another model via OpenRouter](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/providers.html).

**Skills for Codex.** Codex has no `/<slug>` slash commands, so on session setup
MulmoTerminal **mirrors the workspace's `.claude/skills` into `~/.codex/skills`** (each
mirrored directory carries a `.mt-mirror` marker so a re-sync overwrites what MulmoTerminal
owns and never clobbers Codex's own skills), and rewrites a collection's `/<slug> …` seed
into a plain `Use the "<slug>" skill.` instruction. The same skills Claude uses then show
up for Codex, loaded by description.

## Running the server on another machine

The server can live on a Linux box, a VPS or a container while your browser stays on your laptop:
start it there over SSH (`npx mulmoterminal`), and reach it through an SSH tunnel
(`ssh -N -L 34567:127.0.0.1:34567 you@server`, then open `http://localhost:34567`). Started over
SSH, the launcher opens no browser on the server and prints that command. It still listens on
loopback only — nothing is opened to the network. Logging the agents in on the server, Docker, and
the few actions that act on the server's machine: [Run the server on another machine](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/remote.html).

---

## Session persistence (tmux)

If **`tmux` is installed**, MulmoTerminal runs each Claude session and launcher inside
a tmux session, so **a server crash or restart doesn't kill your terminals** — the
processes keep running and reattach when the server comes back (like `screen`/`tmux`).
A long build, a dev server, or a mid-turn Claude session all survive `node --watch`
reloads and crashes. It uses its **own** tmux server (`-L mulmoterminal`) and config, so
it never touches your personal tmux sessions or keybindings.

**And the server comes back by itself.** `npx mulmoterminal` supervises the server it
started: a crash is restarted with a short backoff, so the browser tab reconnects to the
sessions tmux kept rather than to a dead port — which matters most from a phone, where
there is no terminal to start it again in. A stop you asked for is still a stop:
`mulmoterminal stop`, the Stop button, Ctrl+C and `kill` all end it. A server that never
managed to bind is not restarted either — the reason it printed is the answer, and
retrying would bury it. Repeated failures give up rather than respawn forever.

**Not on Windows**, where it is not yet possible: Node has no real signals there, so every
way of stopping the server terminates it outright, and the launcher cannot tell that from
a crash. Windows keeps the old behaviour — the launcher ends when its server does.

**No tmux? No problem** — terminals fall back to plain (non-persistent) PTYs, exactly as
before. An explicit close (a cell's ✕) ends the tmux session; a machine reboot does not
survive (tmux itself is gone). Command-cell scripts are ephemeral and not persisted.

**Scrolling back can put a pane in tmux's copy-mode.** A program that does not handle the mouse
itself — a shell, or Codex's normal screen — scrolls through tmux: a wheel-up or a drag enters
copy-mode, where keys move through the history instead of reaching the program. While a pane is
in it, the cell shows a **"Viewing history" banner** with a **Back to input** button; `q` works
too. Leaving sends nothing to the program, and keys typed right after the button are not lost.

**Installing tmux** (optional):

```bash
brew install tmux            # macOS (Homebrew)
sudo apt install tmux        # Debian / Ubuntu
sudo dnf install tmux        # Fedora
```

On Windows there's no native tmux, so sessions use the non-persistent fallback — run the
server under **WSL** if you want persistence. Nothing else is required: MulmoTerminal
detects `tmux` on `PATH` at startup and uses it automatically when present.

## Tech stack

| Layer    | Technology |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Frontend | Vue 3 (`<script setup>` + TypeScript), Vue Router, Vite, xterm.js (`@xterm/*`), CodeMirror 6, socket.io-client |
| Backend  | Node (ESM, TypeScript run via `tsx`), Express 5, `ws` (terminal WebSocket), `node-pty`, socket.io, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (in-process GUI MCP) |
| Plugins  | GUI-protocol Vue plugins (`@mulmoclaude/*`, `@mulmochat-plugin/*`): markdown, form, image, chart, HTML, collection, accounting, mulmoscript (MulmoCast video/slides), google |
| Tests    | Vitest + @vue/test-utils + jsdom |

Requires **Node ≥ 22.12** (uses `node --env-file-if-exists`) and, by default, the `claude` CLI —
found on `PATH` or named by `CLAUDE_BIN`. Declaring a different default agent (`--agent codex`, or
`"defaultAgent"` in `~/.mulmoterminal/config.json`) makes start-up check that agent instead (#2082):
see [Starting without Claude Code](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/agents.html#default-agent).

## Configuration

The server is configured entirely through environment variables, optionally
loaded from a `.env` file. `npx mulmoterminal@latest` reads the `.env` **in the
directory you run it from**; the npm scripts read the one in the repo root. The
`.env` is optional — every variable below has a default, so the server runs
without one.

A variable already set in your shell wins over the same name in `.env`, so
adding a file never overrides what you exported. The server's environment is
inherited by every terminal it starts, so anything in `.env` is also visible to
the `claude` / `codex` sessions themselves.

| Variable     | Default        | Description |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| `PORT`        | `34567`        | Backend HTTP/WebSocket port (prod: the URL you open). |
| `CLIENT_PORT` | `6856`         | Vite dev-server port (dev only: the URL you open with `yarn dev`). |
| `CLAUDE_BIN` | `claude`       | The Claude Code binary to spawn. On Windows a bare name is resolved on `PATH` before it reaches the PTY layer (which matches file names exactly): to the `.exe` when there is one, otherwise to the `.cmd` shim an npm-global install leaves, run through `cmd.exe`. |
| `CLAUDE_CWD` | current dir    | Working directory each `claude` PTY runs in; determines which project's sessions are listed. Via `npx mulmoterminal@latest` it defaults to the directory you ran the command from (override with `--cwd <dir>`, relative allowed); when the server is run directly it falls back to `~/mulmoclaude`. A value read from `.env` must be an absolute path (`~` is not expanded). Running in one of your own project directories does **not** litter it — see the note under the table. |
| `CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE` | `auto` | Permission mode passed to each `claude` spawn. A Claude Code whose `--help` does not list the mode is not started: the cell says so, and for `auto` says to update Claude Code. |
| `MT_TITLE_SOURCE` | `transcript` | Where the cell header's AI title comes from. `transcript` reads the title Claude Code writes into its own transcript — no extra process. `headless` restores the old behaviour of summarizing the recent turns with `claude -p`, which costs a model call but follows a session whose topic drifts (Claude's own title is written once and never revised). |
| `MT_TITLE_MODEL` | `haiku` | Model used for the cell header's AI title. Only read when `MT_TITLE_SOURCE=headless`. Accepts a `--model` alias or a full model id. |
| `CODEX_BIN`  | `codex`        | The Codex CLI binary to spawn. |
| `CODEX_MODEL`| codex default  | Model passed to Codex as `--model` (unset = Codex's own default). |
| `CODEX_HOME` | `~/.codex`     | Codex home — where its session rollouts and MulmoTerminal-mirrored skills live. |
| `ANTIGRAVITY_BIN` | `agy`     | The Antigravity CLI binary to spawn. |
| `ANTIGRAVITY_MODEL` | agy default | Model passed to Antigravity as `--model` (unset = agy's own default). |
| `ANTIGRAVITY_HOME` | `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli` | Antigravity home directory containing session brain storage. |
| `GROK_BIN` | `grok`    | The Grok CLI binary to spawn. |
| `GROK_MODEL` | grok default | Model passed to Grok as `--model` (unset = grok's own default). |
| `GROK_HOME` | `~/.grok` | Grok home directory containing its per-directory session store. |
| `MUSE_BIN` | `muse`    | The Muse CLI binary to spawn. |
| `MUSE_MODEL` | muse default | Model passed to Muse as `--model` (unset = muse's own default). |
| `MUSE_HOME` | `~/.local/share/muse` | Muse home directory containing its session index and logs. |
| `COPILOT_BIN` | `copilot` | The GitHub Copilot CLI binary to spawn. |
| `COPILOT_MODEL` | copilot default | Model passed to Copilot as `--model` (unset = copilot's own default). |
| `COPILOT_HOME` | `~/.copilot` | Copilot's config directory. MulmoTerminal registers its status hooks in `<COPILOT_HOME>/hooks/mulmoterminal.json` and reads the session list from `<COPILOT_HOME>/session-store.db`. |
| `CURSOR_BIN` | `cursor-agent` | The Cursor CLI binary to spawn. |
| `CURSOR_MODEL` | cursor default | Model passed to Cursor as `--model` (unset = cursor's own default). Cursor's model names are **account-specific** and a wrong one is a hard exit — check `cursor-agent --list-models` first. |
| `MULMOTERMINAL_HOME` | `~/.mulmoterminal` | Root for managed **git worktrees**. |
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | `~/.claude` | Claude Code's own config directory. MulmoTerminal reads Claude's transcripts (`projects/`), prompt history (`history.jsonl`) and user skills (`skills/`) from it, and `.claude.json` from **inside** it (unset: `~/.claude.json`), which is how the per-project GUI MCP registration is checked (`server/session/project-dir.ts`). Set it in the environment MulmoTerminal starts from, so it matches the one Claude runs under. |
| `MULMOCLAUDE_WORKSPACE_PATH` | `~/mulmoclaude` | Where the managed MulmoClaude workspace lives. MulmoTerminal seeds presets/helps **only** into this directory, so launching in an arbitrary project never writes them there (`server/backends/workspaceSetup.ts`), and it is what decides where MulmoTerminal's own runtime state goes — see the note under the table. Set it to the same value MulmoClaude uses. |
| `MULMOTERMINAL_NO_SKILL_INSTALL` | unset | Set to any value to skip installing the bundled skills (`mulmoterminal-config` and the `-dirs` / `-theme` / `-header` / `-keys` / `-model` / `-notify` / `-bug-report` / `-decisions` family) into Claude's skills root (`~/.claude/skills/`, and `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills/` as well when that is set) and the Codex skills root on startup. |
| `GEMINI_IMAGE_MODEL` | `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` | Model used for image generation (needs `GEMINI_API_KEY`). The default is a **preview** model Google schedules for retirement around mid-2026, so pin a stable one here (e.g. `gemini-2.5-flash-image`) rather than waiting for a code change. |
| `WAIT_REAP_GRACE_MS` | `1800000` | How long a **waiting** background session is kept before it's auto-reaped (`0` or negative = never). |

**Where MulmoTerminal's own runtime state goes.** The launcher defaults the workspace to the
directory you ran it from, which is usually one of your own projects — so the state MulmoTerminal
keeps for itself does not go there. The scheduler's execution state and logs
(`config/scheduler/state.json`, `data/scheduler/logs/`) and the notifier's
(`data/notifier/`) live under `~/.mulmoterminal/workspaces/<workspace-key>/` instead, one
directory per workspace — `<workspace-key>` is the workspace's path folded to a safe name plus a
short digest of it, so two workspaces never share one. What you made stays in the workspace either way: collections, feeds, and the
scheduled tasks you write in `config/scheduler/tasks.json`.

The one exception is the **managed** workspace named by `MULMOCLAUDE_WORKSPACE_PATH`
(`~/mulmoclaude` by default), where that state stays in the workspace — MulmoClaude reads the
same files there, and splitting them would give the two apps different answers.

If you ran an older version in a project directory, what it left behind is inert and nothing
recreates it — but delete the generated files, **not** the whole directory:
`config/scheduler/state.json`, `data/scheduler/`, `data/notifier/`. Leave
`config/scheduler/tasks.json` alone; that one is yours, it is still read from the workspace, and
deleting it deletes your scheduled tasks.

The update-check opt-outs (`MULMOTERMINAL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`, `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER`) are
covered in [Install & run](#install--run).

Example `.env` (gitignored):

```
CLAUDE_CWD=/Users/you/my-project
```

### UI settings (`~/.mulmoterminal/config.json`)

The Settings modal (the gear button) persists per-user UI choices to `~/.mulmoterminal/config.json`
(read/written via `GET`/`POST /api/config`):

![The Settings modal — a sidebar of grouped sections beside the one being edited](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/receptron/mulmoterminal/main/docs/guide/images/settings-tabs.png)

*Open it from the gear button in the toolbar. The **sidebar** groups the sections — Appearance, Projects, Header & launch, Input, Models & servers, Notifications, Integrations, Sessions, Help — and one is on screen at a time; on a phone the sidebar becomes a picker above the section. The interface is available in **English, 日本語, 简体中文, 繁體中文 and 한국어**: it follows your browser's language unless you pick one under **Language** (per browser, like the theme). Translated so far: this modal, the grid's status words, and every button's hover tip and screen-reader label; the rest of the app's words are still English. Under the title, a **Version** row shows what is running: the version from the shipped `package.json`, plus a `commit <sha>` chip on a git checkout — there the version is only whatever was last released, so the commit is what identifies the build. When something newer exists, the row is followed by the header badge's update notice, command included. Pick a **theme**, set the **terminal font size**, **font** and **scroll speed** (and whether sending **returns to the latest output**), set a custom **attention sound**, list the repos the cross-repo **PRs & Issues** view should aggregate, add **launch commands** for grid cells, register your own **MCP servers**, and turn on the switches for what this app writes on your behalf — **issue work comments**, the **PR clone footer**, the **closing summary**, the **decision digest**, the **dev worklog** — no need to hand-edit the config file. Three settings stay with their skill because a form would be the wrong tool for them (`keymap`, `themes`, `buttons`/`chips`); Settings shows what each is doing now and launches that skill. Backends (`providers`), custom agents and accounts are added and removed in **Models and backends**. Note that **theme, font size, scroll speed and the return-to-latest switch are stored per browser** (they're display preferences, so a phone and a desktop keep their own); the rest live in `~/.mulmoterminal/config.json` and are shared by every client.*

| Field        | Meaning |
| ------------ | ------- |
| `cwdPresets` | Quick-pick directories offered when launching a terminal. |
| `soundFile`  | Absolute path to a custom **attention sound**, the fallback for every kind. Empty/unset uses the built-in synthesized chime. |
| `soundKinds` | Which moments beep — see [Notification sounds](#notification-sounds). Defaults to `["finished","waiting"]`; the other kinds are opt-in. |
| `sounds`     | Per-kind sound: `{ "waiting": "preset:coin" }`. A `preset:<id>` reference or an absolute path; a kind with no entry falls back to `soundFile`. |
| `prRepos`    | `owner/repo` entries whose open PRs/issues the cross-repo **PRs & Issues** view aggregates, using whichever CLI the host needs — your own `gh` or `glab` login, so no token is stored here. An entry may name its host — `gitlab.com/group/project` is read with `glab`, and work can be started on it, commented on and turned into a merge request. A host that is neither shows a row saying so. |
| `gitlabHosts` | Hosts that run a **self-hosted GitLab**, e.g. `["gitlab.example.com"]`. Nothing in a URL says which forge a host runs, so declaring it is what lets `prRepos` entries on that host be read with `glab` — everything gitlab.com can do, it can do. Needs `glab auth login --hostname <host>`. Editable in Settings → **GitHub and GitLab**; either way it takes effect on the next server start. |
| `repoDirs`   | `{ "owner/repo": "/abs/path" }` — which local clone work on a repo starts in, when you keep several side by side. Only the *choice* is stored; which clones exist is re-derived from `cwdPresets` on every read, and an entry that no longer names a clone of that repo is ignored. |
| `launchers`  | `{ label, command }` entries offered in a grid cell's launcher besides the agents — any interactive command. A plain shell needs no entry: the Agent Picker's **Shell** option opens `$SHELL` unconfigured. |
| `customAgents` | `{ id, label, agent, command }` entries offered in the **Agent Picker** — your own way of starting Claude Code (`ollama launch claude --model … --`, a wrapper script). Unlike a launcher, Claude Code's own argv is **appended** to `command`, so the cell is a real session: resume, cost, context, GUI tools. `agent` says which agent's arguments to append and is required (`"claude"` is the only value today); `command` must stop taking arguments where Claude Code's begin — hence the trailing `--` above. Up to 8. |
| `filePanels` | `{ id, label, page, command?, extensions }` entries — **your own page beside a file** in the Files pane. The page (one HTML file, sandboxed, no network) can learn which file is open, mark lines in the editor, move the editor to a line, ask its own `command` a question (one JSON request on stdin, one JSON answer on stdout), and put text at the prompt of the terminal beside the pane. What it is for — review comments, lint findings, notes — is the page's business; the app does not know. Global only, `page` absolute, `command` argv not a shell, up to 4. Contract and a complete sample: [`docs/file-panels.md`](docs/file-panels.md). |
| `accounts` | **Beta** ([setup guide](docs/guide/en/accounts.md)). `{ id, label, agent, home }` entries — a second login for Claude Code (`agent: "claude"`) or Codex (`"codex"`), kept in its own config directory `home` (absolute or `~/…`). Picked per cell in the launch form's **ACCOUNT** select (the cell's header then names it); a session started on one runs with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` / `CODEX_HOME` set to it, and is bound to that account for good: resume, cost, titles and history are read from there, session lists show every account's rows, and the toolbar shows each account's 5h / 7d usage beside the default's. An account pointed at `~/.claude` / `~/.codex` itself is treated as the default login: no variable, no gauge of its own. A cell with no account gets no such variable added (whatever MulmoTerminal's own environment carries is inherited as before), so configuring none changes nothing. Up to 8. |
| `quickCommands` | `{ label, text, agents? }` phrases the **phone** offers as chips on a session's terminal view. Tapping one puts `text` in the input box; it is not sent until you press send. `agents` scopes a chip to session kinds — any of `SESSION_AGENTS` (`"claude"`, `"codex"`, `"antigravity"`, `"grok"`, `"muse"`, `"copilot"`, `"cursor"`, `"shell"`); omit it to offer the chip everywhere. Empty by default. |
| `userMcpServers` | `{ id, url }` HTTP MCP servers merged into the `--mcp-config` of the **Claude** sessions that carry the full GUI MCP (codex is handed the GUI server alone, `codexGuiMcpServers`) — a cell whose working directory is the **workspace**, and a session the server starts itself (the phone, a scheduled task) unless it asks for a grid cell's shape, as an issue's seed session does (`issueSpawnOptions`). A cell in a project directory does not get this merge; the MCP config the user wrote is read either way. Takes effect on the next session. |
| `buttons`    | Header action buttons — see [Header buttons](#header-buttons). Omit to keep the defaults; set to replace them. |
| `chips`      | Header info chips (`dir` / `git` / `work` / `diff` / `ctx` / `usage` / `status` / `tools` / `env`, or custom text). `env` shows what this working tree was reserved by [`worktreeEnv`](#per-directory-settings-projectmulmoterminaljson) (`:3010`, clickable) and draws nothing where none is declared. Omit to keep the default set; `[]` hides all built-ins. `work` shows which PR / issue the cell is on (`#977 → #966`) and clears itself when the PR merges — see the [Configuration guide](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/config.html#work-chip). |
| `pushEnabled` | `true` to send a **Web Push** to your registered devices. Off by default; only sends while the **RemoteHost** channel is connected (see below). The master switch — `pushKinds` picks which moments. |
| `pushKinds` | Which moments push: `"finished"` (a turn ended, ✅) and/or `"waiting"` (the agent stopped to ask — a permission prompt or a question, ❓, **once per prompt**). Omit to keep both; `[]` for none. A kind added in a later version stays off until you tick it. |
| `worklogEnabled` | `true` to run the built-in **dev worklog** batch (see below). Off by default (each run spawns an LLM session, so it costs tokens). Editable in Settings → **Sessions and background tasks**. |
| `worklogIntervalHours` | Worklog cadence in hours (default `6`, clamped to `1`–`168`). A stepper in the same Settings section covers the range. |
| `feedRefreshEnabled` | `false` stops the hourly **collection/feed refresh** (one scheduled task per root — the workspace and every saved project directory). **On by default**; only an explicit `false` turns it off, so an existing config keeps the behaviour it has. Saved from Settings (or any `POST /api/config`), it applies at once — the running scheduler rebuilds its built-in tasks; a hand-edit applies after **Settings → Reload config file** (or a restart). Feeds still refresh on demand. Checkbox in Settings → **Sessions**. |
| `calendarSyncEnabled` | `false` stops the hourly **Google Calendar sync** (pulls changed events into collections that declare a calendar). Same default and the same restart rule as `feedRefreshEnabled`; calendar collections still sync on demand. Checkbox in the same Settings section. With both off and `worklogEnabled` off, no **built-in** task is registered. Your own tasks in `config/scheduler/tasks.json` are unaffected — these switches do not touch them, and an enabled one still registers and still runs the tick loop. Only when there is no enabled user task either does the scheduler stop writing its state file and run logs. |
| `terminalSubmit` | Which bytes Claude reads as **submit** vs **newline**: `"cr"` (default — Enter submits, Shift+Enter makes a newline) or `"esc-cr"` (for a Claude Code rebound the other way). Applies to the keyboard **and** the phone remote-view submit, for **Claude sessions only** (shell/codex keep plain Enter). See the [Configuration guide](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/config.html#terminal-submit). Settings → **Terminal keys** offers both, worded as behaviour. |
| `copyOnSelect` | `true` puts a **mouse selection on the clipboard the moment it settles**, with no key pressed (the PuTTY / iTerm2 behaviour). **Off by default** — it changes the clipboard when you may only have meant to highlight something. There is a checkbox in Settings → **Terminal keys**, applied at once; a hand edit of the file needs a **server restart, then a tab reload** (the server reads this file once at startup, and the browser reads the value from it on load). Composes with the `copy` keymap action rather than replacing it. Over plain `http://` the browser gives a page no clipboard access, so a fallback asks xterm to copy instead; see the [Configuration guide](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/config.html#copy-on-select). |
| `questionPaneEnabled` | `true` offers a Claude session's **`AskUserQuestion` choices as buttons** in a pane beside the enlarged terminal. **The terminal's own dialog stays** and the pane drives it — a click presses the arrow keys and Enter in the real dialog, so either end can answer and the first one wins. Claude sessions only (the choices arrive on Claude Code's hooks). A **single** question can also be answered in your own words — a text box under the buttons writes into the dialog's own `Type something` row; several questions at once, or a multi-select one, get buttons only, and `Chat about this` stays in the terminal. **Off by default** — it lets a pane type into your terminal. Checkbox in Settings → **Terminal keys**, applied at once (the server re-reads the file per question). See the [Feature reference](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/features.html#question-pane). |
| `decisionDigest` | Keep a **Markdown digest of the decisions this project's sessions asked for**, refreshed at startup and every few hours, so an agent can read what has already been decided before asking something similar. Written to `~/.mulmoterminal/decisions/<project>.md` (never into your repository) and served to agents by the bundled `mulmoterminal-decisions` skill. **Off by default** — it is a vision-stage idea, and it writes a file that would otherwise not exist. The digest holds dated facts, never inferred rules. Settings → **Sessions and background tasks** has the switch. |
| `issueWorkComments` | Let a cell **comment on the issue it is working on**: **one comment**, posted when the work starts and then **edited** as the PR opens and merges (closing the issue if the forge has not already), each milestone stamped in UTC. The comment names the working **directory** it happened in — the folder name only, never the path — so a reader can tell which clone, and two terminals do not start the same issue twice. It says it came from MulmoTerminal. CI is deliberately not reported: it is on the PR already, and it flaps. **Off by default**; it writes to the forge, often on somebody else's issue. Needs the matching CLI logged in — `gh` for GitHub, `glab` for gitlab.com and any host declared in `gitlabHosts`. See the [Configuration guide](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/config.html#issue-work-comments). Editable in Settings → **GitHub and GitLab**. |
| `prWorkdirFooter` | Ends a PR body with `work in <clone>` — the directory name of the clone the work happened in, so a PR says which of several side-by-side checkouts produced it. Applies to **both** paths that open PRs here: **⧉ Open PR** appends it to the PR it creates, and every Claude session is told to end the bodies it writes with the same line (the name is resolved by the server, so a session inside a managed worktree still names the main checkout). **On by default**; set `false` to opt out, from Settings → **GitHub and GitLab** or the file — read per PR and per session spawn, so no restart is needed, and a second MulmoTerminal beside this one sees the change too. Appending is idempotent: an existing PR never gets a second copy. |
| `appendSystemPrompt` | Whether a spawned Claude session is asked to end a reply with a **closing summary** — what was asked, what was achieved, what was not (see [Closing summary](#closing-summary)). **On by default**; set `false` to opt out, and a directory's `.mulmoterminal.json` outranks this. Settings → **Sessions and background tasks** has the switch. Read per spawn, so no restart is needed, though a session already running keeps what it was launched with. `true` / `false` only. |
| `autoDirIcon` | Whether a project that sets no `icon` shows the favicon its repository already ships (`public/favicon.svg`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, a web manifest — first hit wins, ordered by how the image survives at 14px). **On by default**; Settings → **Directory appearance** has the switch. A single project opts out with `"icon": false` in its own `.mulmoterminal.json`, which this does not override. A key that was written and got it wrong shows nothing rather than falling back — a broken setting has to look broken. `true` / `false` only. |
| `cockpitLines` | `{ summary, prompt, response }` — how many lines each **cockpit-roster** row shows before it clamps (default `2` / `2` / `3`, each clamped to `1`–`20`). Raising them trades how many sessions fit on screen for reading a long one in place. Three steppers in Settings → **Waiting rows**. |
| `showLoadAverage` | Whether the grid header draws this machine's **load average** beside the 5h / 7d usage windows, as a percentage of its cores (`load 334%` = a 20-core machine with 66.8 runnable processes). **On by default**; amber at 100%, red at 200%, hover for the raw 1 / 5 / 15-minute figures. Settings → **Grid header read-outs** has the switch. A host that keeps no load average (Windows) shows nothing rather than `0%`, whatever this says. `true` / `false` only. |
| `remoteServer` | **Experimental.** The server runs on another machine than your browser (an SSH tunnel — [guide](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/remote.html)): the actions that would act on the server's screen (the file dialog, the file manager, the OS app) are hidden or say why, and a dropped file is always uploaded. **Off unless `true`**; Settings → **Sessions and background tasks** has the box (or set it in the server's config). |
| `fontFamily` | The **terminal font** every session renders in — a CSS font-family stack, e.g. `"'Cica', 'MS Gothic', monospace"`. Set it in Settings → **Terminal font**, applied at once; editing the file instead needs a **restart** (this config is read once at startup). Unset uses the built-in stack (JetBrains Mono / Fira Code / Menlo / Consolas, then CJK faces for Japanese, Korean and Chinese). Unlike the per-browser font **size**, this is one value for the whole host — it names fonts, and which fonts exist is a property of the machine. A directory can override it. See the [Configuration guide](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/config.html#font-family). |

Every MulmoTerminal on the machine shares this one file, so an older build could save over a key a
newer one wrote. It doesn't: a **top-level key this version doesn't recognise is written back
untouched**, which is what makes running two versions side by side — or downgrading for a while —
safe. A mistyped key survives on the same rule, which is deliberate: a line you can still see is
easier to debug than one that silently vanished. See the
[Configuration guide](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/config.html#unknown-keys).

#### Header buttons

Each terminal header shows configurable **action buttons**. Omitting `buttons` (globally or per-dir)
keeps the built-in **starter set**: this branch's PR (git repos, only when a PR exists). Inserting a
file path, revealing the folder, the in-app file explorer, a new terminal here and the GitHub links
are items in the **path menu** (click the directory path on the terminal header). Setting `buttons` (at either level) **replaces the whole default
set** with your list (it is not merged on top), so listing your own — even a **shorter** one — is how
you drop, reorder, or swap them.
A button has an `id`, `label`, and a `run` of `"shell"` (run a command), `"input"` (send text to the
agent), `"open"`, or `"action"` (act on the cell itself, named like the `keymap` actions so one operation is
a button, a key and a command-palette entry — `action: "terminal-restart"` ends the agent and starts
it again in the same cell on the same conversation, which is how an MCP / config / plugin change
takes effect; it costs a resume and asks nothing first. `"terminal-new-here"` opens the launch panel
on the cell's directory, and `"pane-files"` / `"pane-prompts"` / … / `"terminal-timeline"` /
`"terminal-talk"` / `"terminal-park"` / `"terminal-copy-code"` / `"terminal-insert-path"` / `"terminal-reveal"` /
`"terminal-voice"` / `"terminal-diff"` / `"terminal-note"` do what the cell's menus and buttons do, and `"screen-*"` / `"settings-open"` /
`"sound-toggle"` / `"view-toggle"` / `"order-*"` / `"page-next"` / `"page-prev"` do what the toolbar and the page tabs do; the old name `"restart"` still works). An `open` button targets one of `url` / `reveal` (OS file manager) / `files`
(in-app explorer) / `view` (a built-in overlay) / `terminal` (a dir → a new cell running `$SHELL`,
opened next to the current one) / `pr: true` (open the current branch's PR — the button is hidden when
there's no open PR) / `pickFile: true` (OS file dialog → insert the path).
An entry with `items` instead of `run` is a **folder**: one icon that opens a menu of the buttons
inside it (one level only — a folder cannot hold a folder).
`${dir}`, `${branch}`, `${repo}`, … substitute live context, and `when` (e.g. `"isGitRepo"`) gates
visibility. The `/mulmoterminal-header` skill writes a valid config interactively; per-dir buttons
merge over the global ones by `id`, while `chips` replace the global list wholesale.

### Notification sounds

Six moments can beep, each with its own sound and its own on/off switch. Running many
agents at once is what turns notifications into noise, so **only the first two are on by
default** — the rest are opt-in from Settings.

| Kind | When | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `finished` | the turn ended and the output is unread | **on** |
| `waiting` | it stopped to ask — a permission prompt or a question | **on** |
| `command-done` | a **Run cell's** command exited 0 | off |
| `command-failed` | a **Run cell's** command exited non-zero, or never started | off |
| `session-exited` | a session's terminal ended — **including when you close the cell yourself** | off |
| `pr-ci-failed` | a directory's PR went red. Only seen **while the roster is on screen**, since that is what polls the phase | off |

A **Run cell** is the one-shot cell a `script.json` entry or a `run:"shell"` header button
opens — not a shell launcher cell. A launcher runs an interactive shell that stays alive, so
nothing marks where one command inside it ended; only the one-shot cell reports an exit code.

`finished` and `waiting` reach the phone too (`pushKinds`); the other four are seen only in
the browser — a Run PTY never enters the session registry, and a PR phase is something the
page polls — so Web Push cannot raise them.

**What each one plays.** The default chime is generated with the Web Audio API — **no audio
file is bundled**, so the npm package stays light and has no media-licensing concerns. Beyond
it there are two options:

- **Presets** — seven sounds hosted in the [ownplate](https://github.com/Nakajima-Foundation/ownplate)
  repo (MIT), referenced as `preset:<id>`: `chime` `coin` `cheep` `door` `gong` `magic` `meow`.
  The first play downloads one into `~/.mulmoterminal/sounds/`; every later play reads that
  file, so a preset keeps working offline. A failed download is not remembered as one — you get
  the chime that time and the next play retries. That holds on both sides: the server caches no
  failure, and it answers **503** (not 404) for a preset it could not fetch, because the browser
  remembers a 404 for the life of the page and only retries a 5xx.
- **Your own file** — an absolute path, per kind in `sounds` or as the all-kind `soundFile`.

Resolution per kind, nearest first: the session directory's `sounds[kind]`, its `sound`, your
`sounds[kind]`, your `soundFile`, then the chime. The server streams whichever applies at
`GET /api/sound?kind=` / `GET /api/dir-sound?cwd=&kind=`, and the client falls back to the
chime if it's missing or not audio.

**Web Push on task finish.** Enable `pushEnabled` in Settings to have the server send a
push (title = the project dir, body = the last prompt) to your registered devices each
time a **background** task finishes — the same signal as the attention chime, but for the
panes you're not watching. Delivery is handled by the separate `mulmoserver` `sendPush`
Cloud Function; MulmoTerminal only makes the call, and only while the **RemoteHost**
channel is connected (its Google sign-in supplies the notification auth). With RemoteHost
disconnected, or with no device registered, the toggle is a no-op.

**Dev worklog (cross-clone).** Set `worklogEnabled: true` in
`~/.mulmoterminal/config.json` (or switch it on in Settings, which applies at once; after a hand-edit use Settings → **Reload config file**)
to register a built-in scheduled task. Every `worklogIntervalHours` (default 6) it spawns
a Claude session that reviews the work you did across **all your saved working dirs**
(`cwdPresets`) since it last ran, and writes it up as a short manager-style report.
It runs as a **background worker**: behind the Background filter, never bold, and it takes
no grid cell, so an hourly task cannot fill the grid. Web **Push** still fires for it —
being quiet means out of the way, not unreachable, and it runs while you are away.
Multiple clones/worktrees of the same repo (e.g. `myapp`, `myapp2`) are **merged into one
per-repository section**, each covering what problem was addressed, what got solved, what's
still in progress, and — mined from the transcripts — decisions that were only *discussed
and not built*. The window is **since the last run** (tracked in
`config/scheduler/worklog-state.json`), not a fixed 6 h, so a missed/slept run doesn't drop
work. It reads and reconciles progress against `vision.md` / `milestones.md` (creating
empty ones if absent) so a long-running goal isn't forgotten.

A run due while the server was **off** is not lost: built-in scheduled tasks record their
runs in `config/scheduler/state.json` and **catch up at startup**, each by its own missed-run
policy. The worklog's is `run-once` — a single run covering everything since the last, so
several missed windows don't become several batches summarising the same period. Whether
they ran, and when they run next, is in `GET /api/scheduler/tasks`; the history is in
`GET /api/scheduler/logs` (`?taskId=&since=&limit=`, newest first) and on disk under
`data/scheduler/logs/`.

Output lands in the wiki: one **weekly page** per ISO week
(`data/wiki/pages/dev-log-YYYY-www.md` — filenames are lowercase, or the wiki can't open
them), each tagged `worklog`. To browse them, open the **作業ログ 一覧** hub page
(`worklog`), which links every week, or click the **`#worklog`** tag in the wiki index.

Off by default because each run costs tokens — watch the cost readout and tune the cadence.
Run it on a single "hub" instance; running it in several instances sharing one workspace
double-fires it. The batch treats everything it reads (transcripts, git, wiki) as untrusted
data and only writes the worklog / hub / `vision` / `milestones` pages.

### Per-directory settings (`<project>/.mulmoterminal.json`)

Drop a `.mulmoterminal.json` in a project directory to give terminals opened **in
that directory** their own look and sound. It applies per terminal (per grid cell) —
the rest of the app keeps your chosen theme — and a directory's theme overrides your
manual theme pick for that terminal only. Every field is optional; a missing or
malformed file is ignored.

```jsonc

  "name": "PROD · payments",            // badge shown on this directory's terminals

```

**Already have a `repo.json`?** MulmoTerminal reads it. It is an
[open repository-metadata format](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/repo-json.html) — one
small file any tool can read — and a project that ships one gets a coloured, named, icon-bearing
cell without knowing this app exists:

```json
{ "name": "diffusion-lab", "icon": "docs/logo.png", "color": "#7c3aed" }
```

One colour becomes all seven: the header is it exactly, the badge/border/dot/button/body are
derived from its hue, and the header text is derived for contrast. Anything this app understands
but the open format doesn't goes under `extensions.mulmoterminal`.

The three files layer, general to specific — **`repo.json` → `.mulmoterminal.json` →
`.mulmoterminal.local.json`** — replacing whatever keys the one below it set.

**Several clones of one repository?** Drop a `.mulmoterminal.local.json` beside it. It is read
after `.mulmoterminal.json` and **replaces whatever keys it names**, so the shared file holds what
the project is — name, theme, a colour — and each checkout's local file holds only what makes it
recognisable:

```jsonc
// .mulmoterminal.json — the project. Complete on its own, so one clone needs nothing else.
{ "name": "acme-web", "theme": "nord", "badgeColor": "#1b3479", "headerColor": "#2d4ea9", "orderPriority": 30 }

// .mulmoterminal.local.json — this checkout only. Gitignore it.
{ "badgeColor": "#27b4a8", "headerColor": "#4ed0c5", "orderPriority": 65 }
```

Whole keys, not a deep merge: a `colors` block in the local file replaces the shared one entirely.
Settings → Directory settings names both files and lists which keys the local one took over.

![Four projects color-coded in the grid, each in its own palette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/receptron/mulmoterminal/main/docs/guide/images/grid-colors.png)

*As cells pile up it gets hard to tell which project is which. Give each repo a **name badge** and its own colors in `.mulmoterminal.json` and they're unmistakable — `headerColor`/`badgeColor` tint the frame, while `colors` reaches all the way into the **terminal's own background and text**. (The example above dresses four repos in Mondrian / van Gogh / Picasso / Matisse palettes.)*

| Field        | Meaning |
| ------------ | ------- |
| `name`       | Label shown as a badge in the terminal/cell header. |
| `icon`       | An **image** marking this directory — shown in the cell header, the cockpit roster, the filmstrip thumbnails, the launcher's directory chips, and the phone's terminal list and terminal screen. Either a path **relative to this directory** (an absolute path, or a `../` that escapes it, is rejected), an `http(s)://` URL, or a `data:image/…` URI. PNG / JPEG / **GIF (animated plays)** / WebP / AVIF / SVG / ICO / BMP. Not to be confused with a header **button's** `icon`, which is a Material Symbols name (or `github:<name>` for one of GitHub's icons), or with the small glyph a chat started from a **collection** wears beside its status dot — that one is the collection's own `icon`, and it says which collection the cell was opened for while this one says which directory it runs in. **Omit it and the repository's own favicon is used** (`public/favicon.svg`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, a web manifest — see `autoDirIcon`); `false` means no icon here and stops that search. |
| `backgroundImage` | A **picture shown faintly behind this directory's terminals**, blended with the text so it stays readable on either theme. A string is the image (15% opaque, fills the terminal); `{ "image", "opacity", "fit" }` sets how faint (above 0, at most 1) and whether it crops to fill (`cover`) or shows whole (`contain`). The image follows `icon`'s rules. |
| `badgeColor` | Badge background color (`#rrggbb`); text auto-contrasts. |
| `headerColor` | Header **background** color (`#rrggbb`) — the grid cell's header row and the terminal's own header row (grid row 2). While a terminal is working/blocked the status tint still shows; the custom color applies when idle. |
| `headerTextColor` | Header **text** color (`#rrggbb`) — everything written on the header: the dir path, title and prompt, plus the model/context badge, the token counts and any custom chip. **Omit it and a readable colour is derived from `headerColor`.** It applies while that colour is what shows: a working/done/blocked cell paints the theme's own status tint, so its text returns to the theme's too — an ink chosen for your header colour is not readable on a tint the theme mixed. Recolour those states with `headerStatusColors` instead. |
| `headerStatusColors` | What the header shows once a **status** owns the background: an object keyed by `working` / `done` / `blocked` (there is no `idle` — `headerColor` is idle). Each value is a background `#rrggbb`, or `{ "background": …, "text": … }`. **Omit `text` and a readable one is derived from the background**, so naming one colour can never come out unreadable. A status you don't name keeps the theme's tint. |
| `headerStatusTint` | `"background"` (default) lets a status replace the header background. `"none"` keeps `headerColor` while **working** and **done** — the status still reads from the cell border, the status dot and the pill. It deliberately does **not** reach `blocked`, the one state where nothing proceeds until you answer; give that state a colour of its own in `headerStatusColors` if you want one. |
| `cellColor` | Cell **body background** color (`#rrggbb`) — the frame around the terminal. |
| `cellBorderColor` | Cell **border** color (`#rrggbb`). The status frame (working/blocked) still overrides it while active. |
| `dotColor` | **Idle** status-dot color (`#rrggbb`). The working/waiting colors are unchanged so the activity signal stays intact. |
| `buttonColor` | Header **icon button** color (`#rrggbb`) — expand / close / attach / folder / etc., across both header rows. |
| `theme`      | xterm palette for terminals in this directory (one of the built-in theme ids). |
| `colors`     | Per-key xterm palette overrides applied on top of `theme` (or the app theme when `theme` is unset). Keys are xterm `ITheme` names (`background`, `foreground`, `cursor`, `selectionBackground`, the 16 ANSI colors, …); values are hex (`#rgb` / `#rrggbb` / `#rrggbbaa`). Unknown keys / bad values are dropped. |
| `fontSize`   | Terminal font size in px for this directory (8–32), overriding the Settings value. A size outside the range is clamped; a non-number is ignored. Changing it re-fits the terminal, so the PTY learns the new width — unlike browser zoom, which leaves the two disagreeing. |
| `orderPriority` | This directory's rank in the grid's **priority** ordering — the third mode on the toolbar's ordering button, next to auto (attention-first) and manual (the move buttons). Any integer, **lowest first**; negatives are allowed. Directories that set nothing sort last, keeping their existing order, so adding the key to one project doesn't shuffle the rest. The grid reads it in **priority** mode only; the launcher's directory chips sort by it, so a project sits in the same place on both. The one exception is the **workspace** chip, which always leads the launcher's row regardless of any rank — it is not one of the directories being ranked against each other, and it is the one place a claude or codex session reaches every GUI tool without registering anything (agy, grok and muse get what the directory registered wherever they run — see [MCP server ids](#mcp-server-ids-why-a-workspace-cell-and-a-project-cell-disagree)). |
| `fontFamily` | CSS font-family stack for this directory's terminals, overriding the global `fontFamily`. Use the names as your OS lists them (`"'Cica', 'MS Gothic', monospace"`). An unusable stack is ignored whole rather than half-applied; `monospace` is appended if you name no generic family. Prefer fonts whose fullwidth glyphs are exactly twice the Latin width, or box-drawing frames tear. |
| `sound`      | Attention sound for this directory's sessions, a path **relative to the directory** (served at `GET /api/dir-sound`). The fallback for every kind. |
| `sounds`     | Per-kind override of `sound`: `{ "command-failed": "preset:gong" }`. Each value is a `preset:<id>` or a directory-relative path, under the same confinement. |
| `appendSystemPrompt` | Whether this directory's Claude sessions are asked to end a reply with a **closing summary** (see [Closing summary](#closing-summary)). Omit to follow the global `appendSystemPrompt`, which is on; `true` / `false` here outranks it. Read per spawn, so a new session in this directory picks up an edit without a restart. |
| `worktreeEnv` | Values every working tree of this project needs its **own** of — the port its dev server binds, the database its migrations touch. A worktree isolates files, not ports: two trees running `yarn dev` both reach for 3000 and the second one dies. Each variable is `{ "kind": "port", "base": <1024–65215> }` (a free port, `base` + a multiple of 10 — the checkout keeps `base`, its worktrees take the numbers above it) or `{ "kind": "slug", "prefix": "…" }` (a `[a-z0-9_]` name from the tree's task name, ≤ 63 chars, for a database / schema / container). Up to 16, under whatever names the project reads (`PORT`, `VITE_PORT`, …). A value is **reserved once and kept** (`~/.mulmoterminal/worktree-env.jsonl`) for as long as its declaration is unchanged, so a running dev server's port never moves under it; editing `base` re-allocates, renaming or dropping a variable releases what it held, and removing the worktree releases all of them. Set on every terminal in the directory — agent cell, Shell, launcher, Run command — and shown on the header's `env` chip, where a port is a link to `http://localhost:<port>`. MulmoTerminal hands out the name; creating the database is the project's own job. |
| `addDirs`    | Extra directories this project's Claude sessions may read and edit — the terminal-side equivalent of opening several folders in one VS Code workspace, via Claude Code's `--add-dir`. Relative entries resolve against **this file's directory** (`"../shared-lib"`), a path that doesn't exist is dropped, max 16. Claude only: codex has no equivalent flag and ignores the key. |

**Security.** `sound` and every `sounds` entry are directory-relative paths only — absolute
paths and any `../` that escapes the directory are rejected, and the path is never taken from the
HTTP request, so an opened project can't point the player at arbitrary files.
**When changes take effect.** A write made *through Claude's tools* — which includes the
`mulmoterminal-dirs` skill — applies **live**: the tool hook that reports the write doubles
as the reload signal, so colors, palette, font size and grid order update without reopening
anything. There is no filesystem watcher, so an edit made **outside** a session (your own
editor) is picked up when the terminal is next opened.

**Checking what took effect.** Settings → **Directory settings** lists your recent directories
and expands each one to the values in force, with a swatch per color and the path of the file
they came from. It also names the keys it **dropped** (a color that isn't `#rrggbb`, a size out
of range) and the keys it doesn't read at all (`badgeColour`, a global-only setting) — which is
what tells "I never set that" apart from "I set it and it didn't take".

**Changing it there.** Under the values, **Change here** is a form for the name, the seven chrome
colors, how the header shows a running session (`headerStatusTint`) and its colour per status
(`headerStatusColors`), the terminal theme and palette (`colors`), font size, font family, grid priority, the model its
sessions start on (`provider` / `model`), the closing summary (`appendSystemPrompt`) and extra
directories (`addDirs`), its icon, terminal background, and attention sounds (`sound` / `sounds`), and its header buttons,
chips and command-palette entries (`buttons` / `chips` / `commands`) with the same editors the global
lists use, its Skill menu (`skills`, in order), Mulmo menu decks (`decks`) and per-worktree variables
(`worktreeEnv`) — every key the file can hold. **This checkout only** moves a key into
`.mulmoterminal.local.json` (and **Share** moves it back). A cell's path menu has **This directory's
settings**, which opens Settings on that directory. Each change is written to
the directory's file at once and applies without a restart; **Use global** takes the key out
again. A key `.mulmoterminal.local.json` already holds is written there. Keys the form doesn't
show are left as they are, and a file that isn't a JSON object is not touched — fix it in Files.

## Running

```bash
yarn install            # postinstall fixes node-pty prebuilt binary perms

yarn dev                # backend (:34567) + Vite UI (:6856), concurrently — open http://localhost:6856
# or individually:
yarn dev:server         # backend only  (node --import tsx --env-file-if-exists=.env server/index.ts)
yarn dev:client         # Vite dev server only

yarn typecheck          # type-check everything (vue-tsc -b)
yarn build              # type-check + vite build -> dist/
yarn server             # run backend; serves dist/ + the APIs on :34567
yarn test               # vitest run
```

`yarn typecheck` covers the whole repo. The root `tsconfig.json` is a solution
file that references all five projects, so one `vue-tsc -b` builds them:
`tsconfig.app.json` (client), `tsconfig.node.json` (vite config),
`tsconfig.server.json` (backend, run directly via `tsx` with no build step),
plus `tsconfig.test.json` and `tsconfig.test-server.json` for the specs — which
need checking of their own because vitest strips types rather than checking
them. They exist as separate projects because each has its own compiler options
(the client ones DOM + `.vue`, the server ones node, the specs with
`noUncheckedIndexedAccess` off).

In dev, open the Vite URL; its proxy forwards `/ws`, `/ws/pubsub`, and `/api` to
`:34567`, plus the two mounts that serve a presentHtml page to the Canvas iframe,
`/artifacts` and `/htmlfile` — a page path missing from that list is answered by
Vite's SPA catch-all with `index.html`, which renders as a blank iframe rather
than an error. In production, run `yarn build` then `yarn server` and open
`http://localhost:34567`.

## Scripts (Run menu)

An empty grid cell's launcher sets the **Working directory** by typing, by a preset
chip, or with the **📁 folder button** (a native OS folder dialog). The preset chips are
the directories you have launched in — **worktrees excluded**, since one is a single task's
branch that is deleted with the task, not a place to launch in again; the
**workspace** leads them always, labelled
**WORKSPACE** and marked with an icon, whether or not you have ever launched there — it is
the one directory where a claude or codex session reaches every GUI tool (agy, grok and muse
get what the directory registered, there as anywhere — see
[MCP server ids](#mcp-server-ids-why-a-workspace-cell-and-a-project-cell-disagree)), so it is never a click you can
lose. It has no remove button for the same reason. It is named for its role rather than its
folder, because the folder name (`~/mulmoclaude` by default, or wherever `CLAUDE_CWD`
points) says the least interesting true thing about it; the real path is on its hover.

**The launcher is shorter in the workspace**, because two of its choices do not apply
there. The per-directory **Canvas switches** are replaced by a line saying every GUI tool
is already available — a session there is handed the whole GUI MCP at spawn, so a switch
would register a group URL that then has nothing left to serve. **With Antigravity, Grok or Muse
picked they stay**, in the workspace as everywhere else: none of the three is handed anything at
spawn — agy and grok read their servers from a file in the directory, muse from a plugin installed
for the whole machine — so the switches are their only route to a GUI tool and hiding them would
leave the session with none (see
[MCP server ids](#mcp-server-ids-why-a-workspace-cell-and-a-project-cell-disagree)).
And the **worktree**
section is hidden: a worktree isolates work on one codebase onto a branch, while the
workspace is what a session works *from* (the shared wiki, collections and accounting
live there), which is precisely what a detached branch would cut it off from. Both come
back the moment you point the field at a project directory.

It also offers a
**run a script** row
that launches project scripts (a dev server, tests, a build, …) **in that cell, in
the directory the cell is pointed at** — so a whole workflow lives in one window
alongside the Claude sessions. Scripts are **per-directory**: the cell reads the
`script.json` of whatever directory you select, so different cells can offer
different projects' scripts.

The same launcher also has an **or launch** row for your configured **launch commands**
— any interactive command — set in Settings (the gear button) → **Launch commands** as
`{ label, command }` (e.g. `htop` → `htop`, `Codex` → `codex`). A plain shell needs no
entry here: the Agent Picker's **Shell** option already opens `$SHELL`. Unlike
a one-shot script, a launcher runs as a **persistent terminal in the cell's directory**:
it survives grid page switches and reconnects, and its dot shows running vs. exited (it
reports no activity of its own, so no blocked/done states).

Every running terminal's header also has a **▶ Run ▾** dropdown (next to the
connection status) — but **only when the
open project has scripts** (no `script.json`, no button). It lists the **open
project's** `script.json` — the directory that terminal runs in — and launches the
picked script in a **spare grid cell** (reusing an open launcher, else a new one), so
you can watch it. So you can start a
dev server or tests for the project you're working in without disturbing the
session that's running.

The list is populated from a **`script.json`** at the chosen directory's root. It's
optional; a directory without one simply shows no scripts.

```jsonc
// <dir>/script.json
{
  "scripts": [
    { "label": "Dev server", "command": "yarn dev" },
    { "label": "Unit tests", "command": "yarn test" },
    { "label": "Build", "command": "yarn build" },
    // optional per-script working dir (relative to this file, or absolute):
    { "label": "Sub server", "command": "yarn serve", "cwd": "packages/server" }
  ]
}
```

| Field     | Required | Meaning |
| --------- | -------- | ------- |
| `label`   | yes      | What the launcher shows. |
| `command` | yes      | Shell command, run via the login shell (`$SHELL -lc "<command>"`). |
| `cwd`     | no       | Working dir, relative to `script.json` or absolute. Defaults to the cell's directory. |

A command terminal is **not** a Claude session: it has no session id, no hooks, no
transcript, and **isn't persisted** — it's ephemeral, so a page reload drops it and
closing the cell (or reloading) kills the process. When the command exits, the cell
offers a **↻ re-run**. The browser only ever sends the script's **index** + its
directory; the server reads that directory's `script.json` and resolves the
command, so the file is the allowlist of what can run.

Each command cell also has a **✦ Summarize** button: click it to send the cell's
captured output to `claude -p` (headless) and get a short **Errors / Warnings /
likely cause / suggested fix** note in a panel — handy when a build or install
buries the one failing line in thousands. It's manual (never auto-runs) and analyzes
the last 32 KB of output. See
[`POST /api/command/summarize`](#http-post-apicommandsummarize).

---

## Skills (Skill menu)

Next to the **▶ Run ▾** dropdown, every running terminal's header has a **⚡ Skill ▾**
dropdown — and **only when the open
project has skills** (nothing discovered, no button). It lists the
[Claude skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) discoverable for
that terminal's directory — both **project scope** (`<dir>/.claude/skills`) and **user
scope** (`~/.claude/skills`), the same skills Claude sees — and, on pick, **runs the
skill in that session**: it types the skill's invocation into the terminal and submits
it (for Claude, its `/<slug>` command; for Codex, which has no slash command, a plain
`Use the "<slug>" skill.` instruction). Unlike **▶ Run** — which launches a
`script.json` shell command in a spare cell — a skill runs **in the session you
picked it from**, continuing that conversation.

**Ordering:** working-dir (project) skills come **first**, then user-scope ones,
alphabetical within each group; a project skill of the same slug shadows the user one.

**Filtering:** add a `skills` array to the directory's
[`.mulmoterminal.json`](#per-directory-settings-projectmulmoterminaljson) to narrow the menu —
an allowlist of slugs that also sets the order (only those show, in that order). Omit
it to show everything.

```jsonc
// <dir>/.mulmoterminal.json
{ "skills": ["review-diff", "commit-msg"] }
```

Each menu item shows the skill's id, with its `SKILL.md` `description` as the hover
tooltip. A directory (or workspace) without any `.claude/skills` simply shows no
button. Skills are discovered read-only; the menu never creates or edits them.

---

## Decks (Mulmo menu)

Beside **⚡ Skill ▾** is **⊞ Mulmo ▾** — the decks (mulmoScript presentations) this project offers,
one click from the **Canvas**. It appears **only when there are decks to show** (none, no button),
like the two menus next to it.

Picking one shows it in the Canvas beside that cell, enlarging the cell first if it was tiled.
Nothing is typed into the session and the agent is not asked: this is a viewer, so it costs no
tokens and works while the agent is busy.

**Two sources, both named — the menu never searches your disk:**

1. **`artifacts/stories/` under the workspace** — where the plugin keeps the decks an agent makes.
   Always offered, nothing to configure.
2. **Decks you list yourself**, for one kept inside a repository:

```jsonc
// <dir>/.mulmoterminal.json
{ "decks": ["decks/launch.json", "docs/talks/retro.json"] }
```

Paths are relative to that file and must stay **inside its directory** — `../elsewhere.json` and
absolute paths are dropped, because a config file travels with a clone. Each deck is named by its
own `title`, or by its file name when it has none.

**Why you list them rather than the menu finding them:** a search does find them — along with
everything else on disk that happens to parse as a deck. Measured on a real workspace: **250 files
matched, 33 were the user's own decks and 217 were a checked-out repository's test fixtures and
samples.** A menu is a short list of things you chose.

**Where the decks have to live:** anywhere. A deck under the workspace — or under a directory in
your launcher's saved list (up to 64 in total, read once at startup) — is addressed by its place in
that directory; one anywhere else is addressed by its own path. Either way it opens, and a deck you
open both ways is **one card**, not two. A deck you can see in the file tree is reachable there too
— right-click a row and choose **Open in the Canvas** — with no configuration at all, as long as the
pane knows the directory its tree is rooted at. It shows that path in its header; a pane still
reading `(default workspace)` has nothing to resolve a row against and offers no entry.

If a deck cannot be opened (it was deleted, or the workspace moved since startup), the cell says
why rather than doing nothing.

---

## Files view (browse & edit)

A terminal header can carry a **📁 Files** button — add it as a [header button](#header-buttons)
(`"open": { "files": "${dir}" }`) — that opens a full-screen file explorer
rooted at **that terminal's project directory** — so after Claude says "wrote `foo.md`"
you can jump straight there to read or edit it. The left pane is a lazy-loaded directory
tree; clicking a file opens it in a **CodeMirror** editor (Markdown / JS-TS / JSON
highlighting, everything else as plain text). Markdown files get a **Preview** toggle
that renders via the server's sandboxed `…/md` HTML; a `.csv` / `.tsv` previews as a table (the
same `…/table` document a clicked path opens, in the app's colours), and an `.html` / `.svg` as the
page or picture it is. **Save** (or ⌘/Ctrl-S) writes back. **History** lists the versions the pane
kept of the file (in `~/.mulmoterminal/backups`, taken when it is opened or reloaded here and before a save
here replaces it — the newest few), to compare with the buffer or restore as an undoable edit (unsaved edits
are kept as a version first).

**The open view follows the file on disk.** When an agent in another cell — or any editor —
rewrites what you are looking at, the editor and the preview catch up on their own; there is
nothing to reload. If you have unsaved edits of your own, a banner asks which copy to keep
rather than choosing for you.

The server watches a document while a view is open on it, and only under the workspace or under
a directory one of your terminals is in — the same directories it serves files from. A Markdown
file outside all of those still opens and still edits; it is picked up by the pane's periodic
check rather than the moment it changes, and a Canvas card on it waits for the next thing that
does announce.

**Beside an enlarged terminal, not only full-screen.** Expand a grid cell (**⤢**) and its
header gains a **folder** toggle that splits the enlarged area in two: terminal on the left,
the same explorer + editor on the right, rooted at that cell's directory. Drag the divider
(or focus it and use ←/→, Home, End) to resize — the terminal keeps a floor, so a squeeze
shrinks the pane rather than reflowing xterm into garbage. It works in both zoomed layouts
(cockpit roster and thumbnail filmstrip), the pane re-roots as you walk the zoom between
terminals, and whether it's open plus how wide it is are remembered per browser.

**Coming back looks the way you left it.** The pane remembers the open file, the directories
you had expanded, and — for a file with a Preview — whether you were reading it in **Preview** or
editing it: per cell while the session lasts, and per directory across a browser reload (the
first pane to open on that directory claims it, so a second terminal in the same repository
starts on its own empty tree). A remembered Preview only comes back over that same file while
it is still a file the pane can preview; anything else opens in the editor.

It comes back to **where** you were, too: the line at the top of the editor, the line the caret was
on, and how far down the tree was scrolled. The top line matters on its own — scrolling moves
neither the selection nor the caret, so someone reading without clicking would otherwise come back
to the top of a file they were in the middle of. The caret is kept as a line rather than a scroll offset, so it survives
the pane being a different width next time, and a line past the end of a file that has since been
edited lands on the nearest real one. The Markdown preview's own scroll position comes back too,
and as a pixel offset rather than a line, because a rendered document has no lines in it. The app
still cannot read that frame — it stays sandboxed with no `allow-same-origin`, so the position is
reported BY the document, through the one script the server is allowed to put in it.

**It also paints before it has finished reading.** The last listing of each directory is kept, so
opening the pane on one you have been to before shows that tree at once and swaps in what the
server says when it arrives — including any directory you expanded while waiting. A directory the
pane has not read before says so (`Loading…`) rather than claiming to be empty, and a read that
fails shows the error rather than a tree it can no longer vouch for.

**Several files open as tabs, when you ask for them.** A plain click in the tree replaces the file
in front, as it always has — so someone who never wants a tab never sees one. **Cmd+click** (Ctrl+click
off macOS) or the row menu's **Open in a new tab** adds a tab, and a strip of tabs appears under the
header once there are two. Opening a file that already has a tab goes to that tab, from the tree, the
finder, the search or a clicked terminal path alike. Switching tabs saves the one you leave, exactly as
opening another file does, so only the front tab can hold unsaved edits; each tab keeps its own place
(Preview or editor, caret, scroll) and the whole strip is remembered with the rest of the pane. Close a
tab with its **×**, a middle click, or **Delete** while it has focus; ←/→, Home and End move between them.
The tree follows the tab in front, as VS Code's explorer does: its folders open and its row comes into
view (a reload still puts the tree back where you left it).

**The tree shows what git sees.** In a git repository a changed file is tinted and lettered as in VS
Code's explorer — `M` modified, `A` added, `U` untracked, `R` renamed — and a folder holding changes
carries a dot, so a collapsed tree still says where the agent has been. It is read when the tree
loads or reloads, after a save or an outside change to the open file, and every thirty seconds.

**The editor marks what changed since the last commit.** A bar beside each line that is new (green)
or changed (amber), and a notch where lines were removed, as VS Code's gutter shows them — kept up
to date as you type. **Changes** in the header also shows the removed lines in place, as a unified
diff. Nothing is marked for a file outside git or one not yet committed.

**HTML pages, images, PDFs, video and audio show in the pane too.** An `.html` file has a **Preview** like a Markdown
file: the page itself, sandboxed as presentHtml pages are — its scripts run on an opaque origin with
no fetch/XHR; images and the curated CDN list still load, and so does an image it links beside it,
while a relative stylesheet or script does not. An `.svg` previews as the picture it draws, a PNG, JPEG, GIF or WebP opens as the image
rather than as "not text", a PDF opens in a frame, and a video or audio file plays with the
browser's controls, seeking by range rather than fetching the whole file. A text file too large to edit
says so and still offers **Open in OS**. A path to any of these clicked in terminal output opens in the pane when
it is up, so a chart an agent just wrote stays in the grid. They are served only under the workspace
or a terminal's directory, like every other file the app hands to the browser.

**A link in the Preview opens in the pane.** A link to another file (`./b.md`, `../README.md`) is
resolved against the document it is in and opens in a new tab — in Preview when it is Markdown — or
goes to the tab that file already has. A link that climbs above the pane's folder is not opened and
the pane says so; an external link opens in a new browser tab, and a `#heading` link scrolls the
document.

The toggle is not the only way in: while a cell is enlarged, **clicking a file path the agent
printed** opens it here too, rather than in a new tab or full-screen — see
[Clicking a file path](#clicking-a-file-path).

**Open a file by name instead of walking the tree.** The pane's header has a **search** button
that opens a finder over it: type part of a file's name or path and it narrows a list of every
file in the project — fuzzily, so `fpane` finds `src/components/FilesPane.vue`. Arrow keys and
Enter pick one; it opens in the editor **with the tree expanded down to it**, so the files
around it are one click away. In a git repository the candidates come from `git ls-files`, so
everything your `.gitignore` excludes — `node_modules` and the rest — is never offered; outside
one the tree is walked instead: no ignore file is read, and only a short list of directories
nobody authors by hand (`node_modules`, virtualenvs, caches) is skipped. The panel says so rather
than letting you believe an ignore file was applied. There is also a
[`files-find` shortcut](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/config.html#keymap)
with no default binding, which opens the pane first if it is closed.

A second button searches **inside** the files. Matches are grouped by file with the matching
lines under them, and picking one opens the file *and* puts the cursor on that line. Queries are
literal unless the regex toggle is on, and case is smart — a lower-case query matches either case.
It is `git grep` underneath, so the same `.gitignore` applies, files your agent created seconds ago
are searched, and — because the default reads the **working tree** rather than the index — an
edited-but-unstaged file is searched as it is on disk. The one file no on-disk search can read is
the one you have open with unsaved edits. In the default literal mode that one is searched in the
browser from the buffer and marked `unsaved`, so its line numbers are the ones on your screen. In
**regex mode it is not searched at all** — running a pattern you are still typing on the thread that
draws the UI can freeze the tab — so the file is left out and the panel says to save it. Either way
its stale on-disk matches are dropped, because those line numbers describe a file you are not
looking at. The
[`files-search` shortcut](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/config.html#keymap)
is likewise unbound by default.

All reads and writes go through `GET/PUT /api/files/browse/*?cwd=&path=`, and every
`path` is **contained within the project root** (server-side) — `..`/absolute escapes
are rejected for reads and writes alike, so editing can't reach outside the directory
the terminal is pointed at. A save sends the version the file had when it was opened, so
it is **refused (409) rather than silently overwriting** an agent that edited the same
file meanwhile; the editor then offers to reload or to overwrite deliberately.

You usually hear about it before that. An open file that changes on disk is picked up from
Claude's own write hook (immediately) and from a 30-second version check (which catches Codex,
git, builds and other editors too). A **clean** buffer just takes the new content — the pane
reads as a live view — while a **dirty** one raises the same banner rather than choosing for you.

**Leaving an open file saves it** — switching files, moving the enlargement to another
terminal, closing the pane, navigating away. No dialog interrupts you mid-flow, because
opening a file, and replacing one, keep a copy under `~/.mulmoterminal/backups/` — **three
generations per file**, outside the project so they never reach `git status` or the agent's
view of its own repo. A parting save that loses the version race banks your version there
instead of overwriting the other writer. Re-opening unchanged content doesn't rotate one in, and a backup that
can't be written never blocks the read or the save it was taken for.

## Git worktrees & pull requests

When a terminal's directory is a git repo, its header shows a **branch chip**
(`⎇ <branch>` with dirty / ahead / behind counts), fed by `GET /api/git-status` (polled
while the view is visible). A **GitHub** menu links straight to the repo, its issues, and
its pull requests.

**Worktree isolation.** A grid cell's launch form offers **＋ New worktree**: name a task
and the cell launches its agent inside a fresh
[git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) on a new `agent/<slug>` branch — a
separate working tree that shares the repo's `.git`, so several agents can work the same
repo without colliding. Worktrees live under `~/.mulmoterminal/worktrees/` (override with
`MULMOTERMINAL_HOME`), and existing ones are listed below the field.

**A worktree inherits the project's settings.** A fresh worktree used to have none — no colours,
no name, no model, no grid rank. It is now given its own copy derived from the project's, written
to **`.mulmoterminal.local.json`** so it layers over whatever the repository committed: `name` /
`theme` / `colors` / `fontSize` / `fontFamily` / `provider` / `model` / `worktreeEnv` as written
(the last is a declaration rather than a value — the worktree resolves its own values from it), the
seven chrome colours **rotated 12 degrees further around the hue wheel per worktree** (so a
project's trees read as a gradient; a grey like `#ffffff` has no hue to move and stays put), and
`orderPriority` at the project's rank **+ 1**, so the worktree sorts directly after it. `sound` /
`sounds` / `addDirs` are not carried — they name paths inside the project directory. Written only
where git would **ignore what it writes**: an untracked file in a worktree's `git status` would
make it count as dirty, and a dirty worktree is one MulmoTerminal refuses to remove. The local
override is preferred; a repo that ignores `.mulmoterminal.json` instead (the setup this feature
shipped with) still gets its colours there. A committed shared config is never written to. A local
file the worktree already has is never overwritten.

**One worktree, one session.** A worktree is tied to a branch, so it is never started
twice: a listed row **resumes** that worktree's session when it has one, and **starts** one
only when it has none. A row whose session is open in another terminal reads `in use` and
cannot be clicked — close it there first. The refusal follows the *directory*, not the row:
the same worktree reached by pasting its path into **WORKING DIRECTORY**, or by a recent-dir
chip, will not launch either — and the **server** refuses the spawn whichever client asks,
so a path spelled another way (a trailing slash, a symlink) does not slip past.

What the limit covers is an **agent** — every entry in `TERMINAL_AGENTS` (Claude, Codex, Antigravity, Grok, Muse, Copilot, Cursor) — including an **OR
LAUNCH** command that runs one of them. A **Shell**, and a launcher that runs anything else
(`yarn dev`, `lazygit`, `htop`), stays free — a worktree an agent is working in is exactly
where you want those. A project that declares `worktreeEnv` also gets **its own value per
worktree** for each variable it declares there — so two dev servers given a port of their own do
not both reach for 3000 (see
[`worktreeEnv`](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/config.html#worktree-env)).

The same holds for **OR RESUME HERE**: a session someone is holding is listed with `● open`
and refused, where before it could be confirmed away — which detached whoever had it.
"Someone" means any terminal anywhere, including another browser tab and a second
`mulmoterminal` process on this machine: the server answers from its own PTY table plus
tmux, not from what one page can see.

**Change the directory and those lists empty immediately**, replaced by a single
`Loading this directory's sessions, worktrees and scripts…` row until the new ones arrive.
Everything the launch form offers below the field — **OR RESUME HERE**, the worktrees and
**OR RUN A SCRIPT** — belongs to the directory it was read for, and reading it costs a
debounce plus a round trip. Rows left standing through that wait would be the previous
directory's, listed under the new directory's name, and clicking one resumes exactly the
session it offers.

A worktree started **from an issue** gets an `issue/<N>-<slug>` branch instead. The number
in the name is what later tells the app which issue the work belongs to: the ⧉ Open PR
button puts `Fixes #<N>` in the PR body, and the branch chip, the issue work comment and
the merge-time auto-close all read the same number rather than guessing at it.

That path also **fetches first and forks from `origin/<base>`**, because several clones of
one repo often run side by side and only the one being worked in gets pulled — forking from
the local branch would start the work on however old that clone happens to be. A local base
that already contains the remote wins anyway (it is a superset, so nothing is lost), and
with no remote reachable the local branch is used and the worktree is still created.
Typing a task name yourself keeps the local base it has always used, with no fetch.

![An empty cell's launch form — choose the agent, working directory, or a worktree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/receptron/mulmoterminal/main/docs/guide/images/grid-launch-form.png)

*Every empty grid cell shows this launch form: pick an agent in the **Agent Picker** (**Claude / Codex / Antigravity / Grok / Muse / Copilot / Cursor / Shell**), type a **working directory** (frequent ones autocomplete from your presets), or — in a git repo — name a task under **OR ISOLATE IN A WORKTREE** and hit **＋ New worktree** to start the agent on its own isolated branch. **Shell** runs your OS default shell there instead of an agent; **OR LAUNCH** runs one of your configured launch commands.*

A worktree cell's header carries a **diff badge** (`+<commits> ●<dirty>`); click it for a
**Changes vs `<base>`** panel (file list + patch) with actions:

- **✓ Commit** — hands the cell's own session a canned commit prompt.
- **⬆ Push** — `git push -u origin <branch>` (`POST /api/worktrees/push`).
- **⧉ Open PR** — pushes, then `gh pr create … --fill`; if `gh` is missing or unauthed it
  falls back to opening the GitHub **compare** URL (`POST /api/worktrees/pr`).

Closing a worktree cell asks whether to **keep** the worktree or **discard & remove** it
(a dirty worktree is never removed unless you confirm).

**PRs & Issues (cross-repo).** The toolbar's **Pull requests** button (shown once at least one
repository is listed) opens a full-screen view that aggregates open PRs **and** issues across the repos listed in Settings →
**Pull request repos** (`prRepos`, `owner/repo` entries, or `gitlab.com/group/project` — plus any host declared in `gitlabHosts`) via your server-side `gh` / `glab` login.
PRs show a CI-rollup / review-decision / draft badge; each repo lists its latest open
issues. Rows are real links, per-repo errors don't sink the view, and the two lists load
independently. Backed by `GET /api/prs` and `GET /api/issues`.

**Starting work from an issue row.** Each issue row carries a **▶** button that does the setup in
one click: read the issue, cut an `issue/<number>-<slug>` worktree in your clone of that repo, and
open Claude there as a grid cell with the issue **typed into its input box but not sent**. The
**Start issues in** menu above the list picks another agent instead (and, for Claude or Codex, an
account); every agent but Claude runs the issue text at once, which the view warns about. The
prompt is seeded server-side as a *draft* (`server/session/draft-injection.ts`), which waits for
claude's input box to be ready — text pushed in before that lands in the scrollback instead. A repo
with several clones asks which one the first time and remembers the answer; a repo with no clone
here disables the button and says why. Backed by `POST /api/issues/start`.

**Which clone a repo's work happens in.** `GET /api/repo-dirs` answers the reverse of the
GitHub link a cell already shows: given `owner/repo`, which of your saved directories are
clones of it. The candidates are derived from your directory presets by reading each one's
`origin` — there is no second list to keep in step — and are ordered by each directory's
`orderPriority`, then by path. Several clones of one repo commonly run side by side, so the
answer is a choice rather than a lookup; once you make it, `repoDirs` in the config records
`owner/repo` → the chosen path and it is used from then on. A recording is dropped if the
directory is no longer a saved clone of that repo, and a repo with no clone here is simply
absent from the answer — which is how a caller learns work cannot start on it.

## Cost & token usage

Each grid cell's header shows two badges for its session, refreshed when a turn finishes
(from `GET /api/session/:id`):

![A live Claude cell's header, close up — the model·context and token badges this section describes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/receptron/mulmoterminal/main/docs/guide/images/grid-cell-live.png)

*Both badges, live on a real Claude session: **`Sonnet · ctx 9%`** (model family + how full its context window is) and **`⇡1.8M ⇣6.9k`** (cumulative input / output tokens for the session). They sit in the header's first row alongside the **status dot** and the **git chip** (`⎇ main ●2`), with what the agent is doing to the right; the working directory, the icon buttons and the **timeline** (🕘) of tool calls are on the second row.*

- **Context badge** — e.g. `Opus · ctx 35%`: the model family plus how full its context
  window is (the *last* turn's input + cache tokens ÷ the model's window — **1M** for
  current-gen Opus / Sonnet / Fable / Mythos, **200k** otherwise). A session running on a
  [provider model](#agents-claude-codex-antigravity-grok-muse-copilot--cursor) shows that model's name and its published window
  (`Kimi K2.7 Code · ctx 12%`); a model in neither list keeps the label and hides the %,
  since the window is never guessed. A reading **past 100%** shows `ctx ?` instead of the
  number: the window is a hard cap, so an impossible percentage means the built-in window
  table is out of date for that model rather than that the session is over-full.
- **Token badge** — `⇡<in> ⇣<out>`: cumulative input (fresh + cache-read + cache-creation)
  and output tokens for the session, k/M-formatted, with a full breakdown in the tooltip.

**Both badges are read from the agent's own log**, so what each agent can show differs by
what it writes down (`?agent=` on the route picks the reader):

| Agent | Context badge | Token badge |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude** | `Opus · ctx 35%` — window from the table above | full |
| **Codex** | `gpt-5.5 · ctx 21%` — window from codex's own `model_context_window`, so no table to be out of date | full |
| **Grok** | `grok-4.5 · ctx 33%` — window from grok's own `contextWindowTokens`, so no table either | full |
| **Antigravity** | `Gemini 3.6 Flash · ctx 78%` — the model from the first step of the conversation's transcript, the reading from agy's own per-generation accounting (a real 256k window, not a table) | full |
| **Muse** | `Muse · ctx 27%` — both from the `model_completed` events in the session.jsonl muse's sqlite index points at. Muse states no window, so this is the one non-Claude badge whose percentage **does** come from the table above | full |

The token badge hides itself when nothing has been counted, and the context badge shows
the model alone unless it has **both** a *current-context* token count from the agent and a
context window — agent-reported (codex, Grok, Antigravity) or resolved from the built-in table
above (Claude, provider models). Either one missing means a name and no percentage. The two
badges are independent: an Antigravity session whose accounting cannot be read still shows
its model, and one whose cumulative totals are zero still shows a percentage. The context badge is absent
entirely until an agent has named a model: codex and Antigravity file their logs under an id
the agent mints *after* the session starts, so a brand-new cell shows no model badge until it
has been prompted once — a few seconds, not the rest of the session.

Antigravity's numbers are the one case read from a store with **no published format**: agy keeps
its per-generation accounting as protobuf in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/conversations/<id>.db`,
with no schema on disk, so the fields are identified by measurement (see
`server/agents/antigravity-usage.ts`). Every layer of that reader is built to answer *nothing*
rather than a number it is unsure of, so if a future agy release moves those fields, an
Antigravity cell falls back to showing its model alone — it will not show a wrong percentage.

The **Settings** modal (the gear button) shows an **estimated $ cost** — Session / Today / Month — from
`GET /api/cost`, using a built-in public per-model price table (cache reads billed at
0.1×, cache writes at 1.25× input). It's an estimate: real billing differs, **flat-plan
(Max) usage isn't reflected**, and turns on unpriced models are flagged and excluded.

A separate, full **double-entry accounting** book (the `account_balance` button first on the
Collections screen's top row → `/accounting`) is provided by the bundled `@mulmoclaude/accounting-plugin` and stores its
books under `<workspace>/data/accounting`. It's a bookkeeping app — unrelated to the LLM
cost estimate above — and is also exposed to Claude as the `manageAccounting` GUI tool.

---

## Wiki, Collections & the GUI panel

MulmoTerminal is also a **live view over the shared workspace** (`CLAUDE_CWD`, default
`~/mulmoclaude`) that agents author into — never a snapshot, so it re-reads on entry.

**GUI panel.** Beside the terminal, a **GUI panel** ("Canvas") renders the rich results of
GUI-protocol tools the agent calls — documents (`presentDocument`), forms (`presentForm`),
generated images, charts, HTML, and collection cards. Each result is drawn by its plugin's
own Vue view inside a Shadow-DOM `PluginFrame` (so a plugin's bundled CSS can't leak),
mirrors the active session, and replays history on re-select. Plugins reach the agent over
an **in-process MCP server** served per session at `POST /api/mcp/:sessionId`. Which plugins
load is gated by `plugins/plugins.json`; the shipped set includes markdown, form, image
generation (needs `GEMINI_API_KEY`), chart, HTML, collection, and mulmoscript (MulmoCast
video/slides/PDF playback) views. You can also merge your **own HTTP MCP servers** into a
workspace session via Settings → `userMcpServers`.

### MCP server ids: why a workspace cell and a project cell disagree

A tool is never called by its own name. Every MCP client prefixes it with the id of the server
it came from — `mcp__<id>__presentChart` in Claude Code, `mcp-<id>-presentChart` in Codex (which
also rewrites `-` in the id to `_`). So the id you register under is repeated on every tool, in
every listing, for the life of the session.

MulmoTerminal delivers the GUI MCP by **three different routes**, and they do not share an id.
Which route an agent takes is `FULL_GUI_MCP_AGENTS` in `common/guiMcpAgents.ts`, and the test is one
question: can this CLI be handed a session-scoped payload on a per-spawn flag? **Claude, Codex and
Copilot** can. **Antigravity, Grok and Cursor** cannot — they read a file in the directory — and
**Muse** reads neither, which is the third route below.

**Cursor is half of each**, and the half nobody would guess is the second: it reads a file in the
directory as agy does (`.cursor/mcp.json`, written by `server/agents/cursor-mcp.ts`), but it starts
that MCP server on a CURATED ENVIRONMENT rather than its own — so the group and the port travel as
ARGV, as muse's do, and the SESSION is resolved through `/api/mcp-resolve`. An agy-shaped entry (group
in `env`, port inherited) was tried first and reached the bridge with no port at all. Cursor also refuses to
load a server it has not APPROVED and says nothing when it skips one, so each entry is approved with
`cursor-agent mcp enable` as the cell starts.


| | Workspace cell / single view | Project-directory grid cell |
|---|---|---|
| How it arrives | generated per spawn into `--mcp-config` (Claude), `-c mcp_servers.<id>.url=` (Codex) or `--additional-mcp-config` (Copilot) | the user's OWN per-folder config — `.mcp.json`, `claude mcp add -s local` |
| Server id | **`mt`** | **`mulmoterminal-render`**, `-data`, `-media`, `-external` — one per tool group |
| Tools carried | all of them, on one URL | only the groups that directory registered |
| Tool name looks like | `mcp__mt__presentChart` | `mcp__mulmoterminal-render__presentChart` |

The third route is **Muse**, which reads neither a flag nor a file in the directory: its MCP servers are
declared by an installed **plugin**, and `muse plugins install` records one per MACHINE. So
MulmoTerminal registers a single `mulmoterminal` plugin holding all four group servers, and each
session is narrowed back to what its own directory switched on — the bridge asks the server which
session it belongs to (by its process tree) and is told which groups that session may reach. The
servers are named by group alone, because Muse composes the tool name out of both ids:

| | Muse cell (anywhere) |
|---|---|
| How it arrives | a `mulmoterminal` plugin installed for the machine, re-registered whenever the bridge path or port changes |
| Server id | **`render`**, `data`, `media`, `external` — inside the `mulmoterminal` plugin |
| Tools carried | only the groups that directory registered; the rest serve an empty toolset |
| Tool name looks like | `mcp__plugin_mulmoterminal_render__presentChart` |

Muse's plugin support is behind its own experimental flag (`MUSE_EXPERIMENTAL_PLUGINS`), which
MulmoTerminal sets on the sessions it starts. A Muse build without it simply has no GUI tools —
the registration fails with one warning and the session starts anyway.

**A Muse session picks its plugins up when its own process starts, and MulmoTerminal's sessions
outlive the server.** So a Muse cell that was already running when you switched a group on — or
when you first upgraded to a version that has this — keeps no tools until that CELL is started
again. Restarting the server is not enough: the session is still there in tmux and gets reattached,
exactly as it was. Close the cell and open a new one (or `Stop` it in Settings → Surviving sessions),
and it comes back with the tools its directory registered.

Which route a session takes is decided by `carriesFullGuiMcp()` in
`server/session/mcp-config.ts` — the single view, a cell-less chat, or anything whose cwd **is**
the workspace take the first; anything in a project directory takes the second.

**The workspace is agent-agnostic for the agents that can RECEIVE a per-spawn config** — claude,
codex and copilot ask the same predicate, so two terminals in the workspace reach the same tools no
matter which of the three started them. **Antigravity, Grok, Muse and Cursor cannot, and that is the
exception you will meet first:**

| Started as | In the workspace | In a project directory |
|---|---|---|
| claude cell (including `?gui=0`) | `mt`, every tool | the directory's registered groups |
| codex cell | `mt`, every tool | the directory's registered groups |
| copilot cell | `mt`, every tool | the directory's registered groups |
| cursor cell | **the directory's registered groups** — nothing registered means **no GUI tools at all** | the directory's registered groups |
| antigravity cell | **the directory's registered groups** — nothing registered means **no GUI tools at all** | the directory's registered groups |
| grok cell | **the directory's registered groups** — nothing registered means **no GUI tools at all** | the directory's registered groups |
| muse cell | **the directory's registered groups** — nothing registered means **no GUI tools at all** | the directory's registered groups |
| any launcher chip | untouched | untouched |

None of those four takes an MCP flag: `agy` reads `.agents/mcp_config.json`, `grok` reads
`.grok/config.toml` and `cursor` reads `.cursor/mcp.json` in the working directory, and `muse` reads a
plugin installed for the whole machine — and neither a file shared by every session in a directory nor
a machine-wide plugin can be handed to one session and not another — so there is nothing for "this cwd
is the workspace" to change. The
membership is `FULL_GUI_MCP_AGENTS` in `common/guiMcpAgents.ts`, in `common/` precisely so the
launcher form and the spawn cannot disagree about it
([#1423](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoterminal/issues/1423)).

The consequence is easy to hit and hard to guess: `presentDocument` works in a project you once
flipped **Canvas** on for, and is missing in the workspace where everything else is automatic. Fix it
the same way anywhere — pick **Antigravity**, **Grok**, **Muse** or **Cursor**, point WORKING
DIRECTORY at that directory, flip the **Canvas** switch (it stays visible for all four), and start a
**new** session; the switch registers the directory, never a session already running. Full procedure:
[Antigravity, Grok, Muse and Cursor register everywhere](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/basics.html#antigravity-gui-tools)
· [日本語](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/ja/basics.html#antigravity-gui-tools).

**A launcher chip is not an agent session — it is a command.** Whatever the command line names,
it runs exactly as written: nothing is inserted, and no GUI MCP is attached. A chip running
`claude` therefore reads only its directory's own `.mcp.json`, and a chip running `codex` has no
Canvas. If you want a chip to reach the GUI tools, put the flags in the command yourself.

Earlier releases did rewrite a `claude` or `codex` chip to match the cell beside it. That was
removed: a chip that silently runs something other than what it says is indistinguishable from
the Agent Picker, which is the confusion the two controls exist on either side of. Use the Agent
Picker for an agent session — it is also the only one of the two that gives you a resumable
transcript, cost and context, and a "waiting for you" status.

**The asymmetry is deliberate.** `mt` is ours to name: nothing on disk holds it, it is
regenerated on every spawn, so it was shortened to stop paying 17 characters per tool name. The
group ids are the opposite — they are keys in config files **users wrote**, they are what the
launcher's per-group switch reads back, and they are documented in the setup guide. Renaming
them breaks working setups silently, and would need a migration that rewrites existing
per-folder configs. Both live in [`common/toolGroups.ts`](common/toolGroups.ts), where the
constants carry the same warning.

**Wiki.** The toolbar **Wiki** button opens a read-only browser over `<workspace>/data/wiki/`
— an **index** (tag-filterable page catalog), rendered **pages** with `[[wiki links]]` and
backlinks, a **graph** view (pages ranked by references), and a **lint** report (orphans /
broken links / tag drift) whose `[[links]]` are clickable too. Read-only endpoints:
`GET /api/wiki`, `/api/wiki/graph`, `/api/wiki/lint`.

**Collections.** The toolbar **Collections** button browses the workspace's collection
"cards" (`@mulmoclaude/collection-plugin`). Running a collection **action** fetches a seed
prompt and spawns a fresh agent session for it — the **Launch with Claude / Codex** toggle
decides which agent (and whether the seed auto-runs or drops in as an editable draft).
Favorited collections get their own toolbar buttons.

That session is an ordinary **grid cell**, and starting it no longer takes the screen to the
grid: while the collection is open, the grid **teleports that cell into a pane below it**, so
the same terminal is driven from whichever view you have open — no hand-off, no reconnect, and
nothing to move back. Several chats under one collection become tabs, each with the grid's own
attention dot and a line of what the shown one is doing; the **Collections** button carries how
many are running behind it. Which collection a chat belongs to survives a reload, and a chat
whose cell is gone drops out rather than sitting over an empty pane. A button in the tab strip
moves the pane **under the collection or beside it** — wide and short for a list you are scanning,
narrow and tall for one record you are discussing — and each position keeps its own size.

## More features

- **Grid of parallel sessions** — the ＋ Terminal / grid view runs many sessions at once,
  auto-sizing by count across pages. Cell borders signal state at a glance — **working**
  (pulsing blue), **blocked** (amber — needs a permission / answer), **done** (blue —
  finished, output unreviewed), and **idle** — and the toolbar shows a tally across all
  pages so you notice an off-screen cell that needs you.
- **Zoom & filmstrip** — a cell's **⤢** enlarges one agent while the rest shrink to
  thumbnails in a bottom **filmstrip**; click a thumbnail to switch, **⤡** to return to the
  grid — so you can flip between "see everything" and "focus on one" in a click. While
  zoomed, keys you bind walk the enlargement along the on-screen order without reaching for
  the mouse — **opt-in, nothing is bound by default**, since any bound key is taken from the
  terminal underneath. Press **Set up shortcuts…** in Settings → **Keyboard shortcuts** and an
  agent writes the `keymap` for you, checking each binding against your existing ones and the traps
  a browser or a Mac adds; that section also lists every action and the `send` row whether bound or not, including the
  [keys sent straight to the terminal](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/config.html#keymap-send).
  To write it by hand, add a `keymap` to `~/.mulmoterminal/config.json` — see the
  [guide](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/config.html#keymap)
  for the syntax, the action list, and combinations a browser can never bind.

![Zoom — one agent enlarged, the others as a filmstrip along the bottom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/receptron/mulmoterminal/main/docs/guide/images/grid-zoom.png)

- **Set a terminal aside** — the bed button (a person asleep) in a cell's header **sinks** it: the tile, its
  filmstrip thumbnail and its cockpit-roster row all fade, and the working dot stops pulsing.
  The session stays **connected and keeps its whole history** — this is what to reach for
  instead of `/clear`-ing a cell you are done with for now, which resets the conversation just
  to change how the cell looks. The setting survives a reload. **Enlarging it keeps it faded** —
  that is how you read a set-aside session without waking it, and its roster row keeps the blue
  "you are here" edge either way — while **typing into it wakes it**, so nothing has to be undone
  by hand. Clicking or scrolling to read it does *not* wake it, even though a mouse-tracking agent
  receives those as input. A cell that **stops for a permission prompt comes back to full strength
  on its own**, so setting one aside can never hide a session that is waiting on you; a merely *finished* turn
  does not, since that is the expected outcome of setting a running agent aside.
- **History menu** (on the cell header) — the Prompts and Conversation panes below, and the
  **Timeline**: a read-only per-session activity timeline (tools run, newest first),
  from `GET /api/transcript/timeline`.
- **Bring another cell's turn here** (💬) — pick another terminal in the grid and its
  **last completed turn** is pasted into *this* cell's input box, so you can have Claude
  and Codex look at each other's work (or pull in a session running in a different repo).
  The excerpt comes from the agent's own log, not the screen buffer, so it carries no
  ANSI debris and nothing lost to scrollback. It is **pasted, never sent** — you read
  what arrived and press Enter, in the cell you were already in. A turn still running
  isn't available yet (Codex writes its rollout only once the turn ends).
- **Tools pane** (the cell header's **Tools** menu, beside the Canvas, Collections and **Restart the agent**) — the available GUI tools plus a live tool-call history for the active
  session.
- **Prompts pane** — the prompts *you* sent the enlarged cell's session, newest first, from
  `GET /api/transcript/prompts`. The mirror of the Timeline above: that one is what the agent
  ran, this one is what you asked it for — for when several cells are running and you can no
  longer remember which one you told what. Read-only; click a long prompt to open it in place.
  Left open, it keeps up by itself. Claude and Codex; it reads what you TYPED (claude's own
  prompt history, codex's rollout), so a prompt sent mid-turn is there and text a skill
  injected is not. A `/clear` draws a line: the pane shows what you have asked *since*, the
  same way the header, the title and the last reply all stop describing the ended conversation.
- **Conversation pane** — the enlarged cell's conversation, read as TURNS rather than as the
  screen, from `GET /api/transcript/view`. A Claude cell runs on the alternate screen, so the
  terminal keeps no scrollback worth scrolling; this reads the agent's own transcript instead,
  and **scrolling up walks the session back to its first turn**, a page at a time.
  - It **takes the terminal's place when you open it** — the one pane that does, because reading
    is its whole subject. The expand button puts the terminal back beside it.
  - **A frame per speaker**: what you asked in one, what the agent answered in another, named
    ("You" / "Claude"). The reply is **rendered markdown** — headings, lists, tables, fenced
    code — not the characters it is written with.
  - **Tool traffic is folded away**, one line saying what ran (`Bash · Read`); click to open it.
    It is most of a turn's bulk and almost none of what you came back to read.
  - A **snapshot**, not a live tail — the terminal beside it is the live view — and the header's
    reload fetches the newest turns again. Claude, Codex, Cursor and Copilot; an agent whose
    conversation no reader here can read yet says so rather than showing an empty pane.
- **Notifications** (🔔) — a toolbar bell with an unread badge and a dropdown of active
  notifications; click a row to jump to its session.
- **Star MulmoTerminal** — a star button in the grid toolbar that stars the project on GitHub
  through your own `gh` login, in one click. It is a one-time ask: once the repo is starred the
  button is gone for good and stops calling the server at all. It shows **only when `gh` can
  answer** — with no `gh`, no login, or no network, one click couldn't star anything, so nothing
  is shown and nothing is recorded. Set `gh` up later and the button appears by itself.
- **Voice input** — dictate a prompt via on-device Whisper (`POST /api/transcribe`, macOS
  only; the model downloads on first use). Settings picks **the language you dictate in**
  (per browser): your browser's, whisper's own per-clip detection, or a fixed one. Worth
  setting — speech in a language the mic is not expecting comes back *translated* into the
  one it is, so an English browser silently turned Japanese dictation into English.
- **Remote host** — link MulmoTerminal to the companion phone client (Google sign-in) to
  watch and start sessions from your phone.
- **Themes** — four terminal palettes (midnight / nord / daylight / solarized), your pick
  remembered; a project's `.mulmoterminal.json` can override per directory.
- **Editing niceties** — **Shift+Enter** inserts a newline in the prompt, and on macOS
  **Option** is treated as Meta so Claude's Alt-key bindings work. If your Claude Code is
  rebound so Enter and Shift+Enter behave backwards, flip them with
  [`terminalSubmit`](https://receptron.github.io/mulmoterminal/guide/en/config.html#terminal-submit).
- **Scroll speed** — one wheel notch or trackpad swipe moves the terminal the same distance
  whether you're reading a shell's scrollback or a full-screen app like Claude Code. If a
  two-finger scroll on a Mac trackpad flies past what you were reading, turn **terminal scroll
  speed** down in Settings (0.25×–3×, per browser — it's a property of the pointing device).
- **No accidental page zoom** — `Ctrl`+wheel and a trackpad pinch would rescale the whole
  page and drag the layout and the terminal's fit along with it, so both are ignored.
  Keyboard zoom (`Cmd`/`Ctrl` `+` / `-`) still works when you mean it, and a phone's finger
  pinch is untouched. To make terminal text bigger for real, use the font size in Settings
  (or a directory's `fontSize`) — that re-fits the PTY instead of leaving it disagreeing.

## Server API specification

Base URL: `http://localhost:$PORT` (default `http://localhost:34567`).

### HTTP: `GET /api/sessions`

Lists the most-recent chat sessions for the current project (`CLAUDE_CWD`),
newest first, including freshly-created sessions that aren't yet written to disk.

**Response `200 application/json`**

```jsonc
{
  "cwd": "/Users/you/my-project",
  "sessions": [
    {
      "id": "d16f43f3-ef63-4a5e-b273-debaccb3522a", // session UUID (= .jsonl basename)
      "title": "Review available skills list",        // see "Session discovery & titles"
      "mtime": 1781471064511.22,                       // last-modified, ms epoch (sort key)
      "working": false,                                // Claude is mid-turn (blue dot)
      "waiting": false                                 // needs attention (bold)
    }
    // ...
  ]
}
```

- Sessions are read from `<claude config home>/projects/<encoded CLAUDE_CWD>/*.jsonl` (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, default `~/.claude`) and
  merged with in-memory sessions started this run but not yet persisted (those
  have `title: "New session"` and `mtime` = creation time).
- Sorted by `mtime` descending and capped at the **50** most recent. Files are
  ranked by a cheap `stat`-only pass; only the top 50 are read and parsed for
  titles, so the endpoint stays cheap regardless of how many sessions exist.
- `500 { "error": string }` on an unexpected filesystem error. A missing project
  directory is **not** an error — it yields an empty `sessions` array.

### Directories that cannot be used

Every `?cwd=` — on the terminal sockets and on the read routes alike — names the directory
the request is about. When one is named and cannot be used, the server says so instead of
quietly answering about the **default workspace** (#1151):

| Where | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| `/ws`, `/ws/codex`, `/ws/antigravity`, `/ws/grok`, `/ws/muse`, `/ws/copilot`, `/ws/cursor`, `/ws/launch`, `/ws/run` | The socket is closed with `{ type: "error", message }`, which the terminal shows as a red banner and does not retry. |
| A session that is still running (`?session=` names a live PTY or a surviving tmux session) | **Attaches anyway**, with a warning in the server log. Moving or renaming a directory must not shut you out of an agent that is still working in it — and the cwd reported back comes from the running PTY, not from the request. |
| `GET /api/scripts`, `/api/skills`, `/api/dir-config`, `/api/dir-sound`, `/api/git-status`, `/api/pr-phase`, `/api/header`, `/api/sessions`, `/api/codex/sessions`, `/api/copilot/sessions`, `/api/cursor/sessions`, `/api/antigravity/sessions`, `/api/grok/sessions`, `/api/muse/sessions`, `/api/session/:id`, `/api/transcript/*`, `/api/cost` | `404 { error, cwd }` — a directory that is not there. |
| A `?cwd=` that cannot name a directory at all (relative, or repeated as `?cwd=a&cwd=b`) | `400 { error, cwd }`. |

A request that names **no** directory is unaffected: `CLAUDE_CWD` is then the answer it
asked for. The wording of the refusal is the one a refused spawn already uses, so the same
condition reads the same whether it is caught here or by `ptySpawn` itself.

### HTTP: `GET /api/scripts`

The runnable entries from `<cwd>/script.json` for a cell's chosen directory
(`?cwd=<dir>`, or `CLAUDE_CWD` when none is named); see
[Scripts (Run menu)](#scripts-run-menu). The resolved `cwd` is echoed back, and each
entry carries its `index` (the position the client sends back to `/ws/run`). A `?cwd=`
that names a directory the server cannot enter is answered `404 { error, cwd }` rather
than with the default workspace's scripts — see
[Directories that cannot be used](#directories-that-cannot-be-used).

```jsonc
// GET /api/scripts?cwd=/Users/me/proj
{
  "cwd": "/Users/me/proj",
  "scripts": [
    { "index": 0, "label": "Dev server", "command": "yarn dev" },
    { "index": 1, "label": "Sub server", "command": "yarn serve", "cwd": "packages/server" }
  ]
}
```

A missing or invalid `script.json` is **not** an error — it yields an empty
`scripts` array.

### HTTP: `GET /api/skills`

The Claude skills discoverable for a terminal's chosen directory (`?cwd=<dir>`, or
`CLAUDE_CWD` when none is named) — project scope (`<cwd>/.claude/skills`) plus user scope
(`~/.claude/skills`), deduped by slug (project shadows user), **working-dir skills
first**; see [Skills (Skill menu)](#skills-skill-menu). A `skills` allowlist in that
directory's `.mulmoterminal.json` narrows and reorders the result; absent → all. The
resolved `cwd` is echoed back. Each entry carries its `slug` (the skill invoked as
`/<slug>`) and the `SKILL.md` `description` (the menu tooltip).

```jsonc
// GET /api/skills?cwd=/Users/me/proj
{
  "cwd": "/Users/me/proj",
  "skills": [
    { "slug": "commit", "description": "Write a commit message" },
    { "slug": "review", "description": "Review the current diff" }
  ]
}
```

A directory without any discoverable skills is **not** an error — it yields an empty
`skills` array.

### HTTP: `POST /api/command/summarize`

Runs `claude -p` **headless** over a command cell's captured terminal output and
returns a short summary (Errors / Warnings / likely cause / suggested fix). Backs the
**✦ Summarize** button on a Run cell (see [Scripts (Run menu)](#scripts-run-menu)).
The browser sends the cell's xterm buffer as `log`; the server truncates it to the
last **32 KB** (the tail, where errors + the exit line live), runs the CLI with the
log piped on stdin (argv — no shell), and returns its answer. Same-origin guarded.

The summarizer gets **no tools** (#1769): the spawn carries a `--settings` deny of `*`,
a `--disallowedTools` list, no MCP servers, and a working directory outside any
repository. A deny rule outranks the ambient allow rules — including the user-level
`~/.claude/settings.json`, which a neutral working directory does not escape — and it
covers tools that do not exist yet, which a list of names cannot. The log being
summarized is not content we control, so this is the guarantee rather than the prompt's
wording (the prompt says it too).

**Request `application/json`**:

```jsonc
{ "log": "npm ERR! cannot find module 'foo'\n..." }
```

**Response `200 application/json`**:

```jsonc
{
  "summary": "Errors: cannot find module 'foo'\nSuggested fix: run `yarn add foo`",
  "truncated": false // true when the log exceeded 32 KB and only the tail was analyzed
}
```

Empty output returns a `{ summary }` note rather than calling the CLI. Errors:
`400` (missing `log`), `403` (disallowed origin), `502` (the `claude` run failed).

### HTTP: `POST /api/hook`

**Internal endpoint.** Hooks POST their event payload here. Claude's are injected per session
(see [Claude hook injection](#claude-hook-injection)); **Copilot's and Cursor's arrive from a
machine-global hook file** and name their agent in an `x-mt-agent: copilot|cursor` header, with the
event in `x-mt-hook` — the body is translated into the Claude shape below before anything reads it
(`server/agents/{copilot,cursor}-hook.ts`), so everything downstream is written against one
vocabulary. A request with no `x-mt-agent` is a Claude payload and is untouched.
You normally don't call this yourself.

**Request `application/json`** — the Claude-shaped hook payload; only these fields are used:

```jsonc
{
  "session_id": "d16f43f3-...",        // the session the event is for
  "hook_event_name": "UserPromptSubmit" // "UserPromptSubmit" | "Stop" | "Notification"
}
```

Effect (see [Session model](#session-model)):

| `hook_event_name`  | Effect |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `working = true` for the session. |
| `Stop`             | `working = false`; if the session is **backgrounded**, also `waiting = true`. |
| `Notification`     | If the session is **backgrounded**, `waiting = true`. |

Any resulting state change is published on the `sessions` pub/sub channel.

**Response `200 application/json`**: `{ "ok": true }` (always, even for unknown events).

### More HTTP endpoints

The endpoints above are the core; the server exposes many more (all under
`http://localhost:$PORT`; query params shown where relevant). Mutating endpoints are
same-origin-guarded.

**Sessions & agents**

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| `GET /api/session/:id?cwd=` | One session's summary — cumulative `usage` and `context` (model + last-turn context tokens). Backs the cell token & ctx% badges. |
| `GET /api/codex/sessions?cwd=` | Codex sessions for the project (from `~/.codex` rollouts), newest first. |
| `GET /api/antigravity/sessions?cwd=` | Antigravity conversations for the project, newest first. agy does record a workspace, but never as a complete conversation-to-workspace map (`cache/last_conversations.json` keeps one conversation per directory and is written at exit; `history.jsonl` carries no conversation id), so the project comes from MulmoTerminal's own `~/.mulmoterminal/antigravity-conversations.jsonl`; agy's transcript supplies the title. |
| `GET /api/grok/sessions?cwd=` | Grok conversations for the project, newest first. `~/.grok/sessions` is partitioned by working directory (percent-encoded), so this is a directory listing; each conversation's `summary.json` supplies the title and the last-active time, falling back to the directory's `prompt_history.jsonl`. |
| `GET /api/muse/sessions?cwd=` | Muse sessions for the project, newest first. Muse keeps one sqlite index for the machine (`~/.local/share/muse/session-index.db`, home overridable via `MUSE_HOME`) with the workspace recorded per row, so this is a query rather than a directory listing. |
| `GET /api/copilot/sessions?cwd=` | Copilot sessions for the project, newest first. Copilot keeps one sqlite index for the machine (`~/.copilot/session-store.db`) with the working directory on each row, so this is a query rather than a directory walk. |
| `GET /api/cursor/sessions?cwd=` | Cursor chats for the project, newest first. Cursor's project directory name is a truncated-and-hashed slug of the path, so this reads each directory's own `.workspace-trusted` to learn which one it stands for and omits any that does not say. |
| `GET /api/cost?cwd=&session=` | Estimated $ cost — session / today / month. |
| `GET /api/transcript/timeline?session=&cwd=` | Per-session activity timeline (tools run). |
| `GET /api/transcript/last-turn?session=&cwd=&agent=` | A session's last completed exchange (`prompt`, `reply`) plus the `text` to paste into another terminal. `agent=codex` reads the codex rollout instead of the Claude transcript. |
| `GET /api/decisions?cwd=&limit=` | The decisions a human was asked to make in this project, newest first — each question with the options it offered, their descriptions, and the answer. `answerKind` says whether the answer was one of the options, text the user wrote instead (the question was wrong), or never given. Read out of Claude's own transcripts; writes nothing. `scanned` reports how many transcripts were read (the scan is capped) and `unreadable` how many could not be, so a partial answer is visible rather than implied. A `cwd` that is not an existing directory answers an empty response rather than falling back to the default workspace. |
| `GET /api/decisions/digest?cwd=` | The same decisions as Markdown, for an agent to read (`{ enabled, markdown }`). `enabled: false` means the `decisionDigest` setting is off — a different answer from an empty digest, so a reader can tell "switched off" from "nothing decided here". |

**Git & worktrees**

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| `GET /api/git-status?cwd=` | `{ repo, branch, detached, dirty, ahead, behind, upstream }`. |
| `POST /api/git-remote` | The dir's GitHub repo URL (for the header GitHub menu). |
| `GET /api/worktrees?cwd=` · `GET /api/worktrees/diff?cwd=` | List managed worktrees / diff one vs its base. |
| `POST /api/worktrees/create` · `/remove` · `/push` · `/pr` | Create on `agent/<slug>` — or, with `issue: <N>`, on `issue/<N>-<slug>` forked from a freshly fetched `origin/<base>`; remove (managed root only), push, open a PR (`gh`, else compare URL). |
| `GET /api/prs` · `GET /api/issues` | Open PRs / issues across the configured `prRepos` — `gh` for github.com entries, `glab` for gitlab.com and any host declared in `gitlabHosts`. |
| `GET /api/repo-dirs` | Which saved directories clone which GitHub repo, ordered, with the recorded choice per repo. |
| `POST /api/issues/start` | Cut an issue's worktree in one of that repo's known clones and spawn a session there, seeded with the issue. An optional `agent` (any hosted agent; absent is `claude`, anything else is a 400) picks which. A Claude seed is a draft; every other agent runs it at once. The reply names the `agent` and whether the seed runs (`seedRuns`), so the cell attaches on the right endpoint. |
| `GET /api/agents/availability` | Which hosted agents this machine can start — `{ agents: [{ agent, available, reason?, installGuide? }] }`, `reason` being `missing`, `no-such-path` (an `<AGENT>_BIN` naming nothing) or `not-executable`, and `installGuide` the agent's official install page (from `bin/agent-install-guides.json`) or `null`. The same check a spawn makes before it starts, run once at server start, so an agent installed later shows after a restart. |
| `GET /api/github/star` · `POST /api/github/star` | Whether you have starred MulmoTerminal, and star it (via `gh`). `starred: null` means `gh` could not answer, and hides the button. |

**Workspace views**

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| `GET /api/wiki` (`?slug=`) · `/api/wiki/graph` · `/api/wiki/lint` | Read-only wiki index / page / graph / lint. |
| `GET /api/collections/…` · `/api/feeds` · `GET\|PUT /api/shortcuts` | Collections browser, feeds, favorites (see `docs/collection-plugin-integration.md`). |
| `GET /api/files/browse/{list,text,version,md}` · `PUT /api/files/browse/{write,backup}` | File tree / read / Markdown-render / write (contained within the project root). `text` answers `{ text, version }`; `write` takes `{ text, baseVersion }` (`null` = expecting to create it) and answers **409** with the version now on disk if the file changed since — so a save can't silently overwrite the agent that edits the same files. `version` answers that token alone, for the editor's periodic check. `backup` banks a buffer the editor is about to discard. |
| `GET /api/files/raw?path=` | Raw asset bytes (workspace-rooted). |

**Conversation rooms**

A room is one conversation, kept apart from the cells having it (`~/.mulmoterminal/rooms/<id>.jsonl`,
append-only). A round table writes every turn into one; the point of it being a file behind an API
is that the things which are **not** agents can join the same conversation — a person in the Rooms
view, a shell, a CI job posting a result. No agent calls any of this: the runner reads their turns
and writes for them, which is why the feature needs no MCP tool.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| `GET /api/rooms` | The rooms that exist, newest activity first. |
| `GET /api/rooms/:room?since=` | What was said, oldest first. A room that does not exist is empty; a room that cannot be **read** answers **500**, so a caller can tell "nobody has spoken" from "I could not find out" and decide for itself (the round-table runner carries on from the previous turn; the Rooms view says so). |
| `POST /api/rooms/:room` | `{ from, text }` — append. `from` is a display name, not an identity, and nothing authenticates it. Text over 4000 characters is clipped, since a room is read into an agent's context. |
| `DELETE /api/rooms/:room` | Forget a conversation. |

From a shell: `mulmoterminal room read <room>` · `room post <room> <text…> [--from <name>]` ·
`room list`. Everything after `--` is message text, so a post can contain `--force` without losing it.

**GUI panel / plugins / MCP**

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| `POST /api/mcp/:sessionId` | Per-session GUI MCP server (Streamable HTTP; `GET`/`DELETE` → 405). |
| `POST /api/plugin/:toolName` | GUI-plugin dispatch (incl. `spawnBackgroundChat`, `manageAccounting`, `presentHtml`). |
| `GET /api/agent/toolResults/:id` · `POST /api/agent/toolResult` | GUI-panel result history / persist. |
| `GET /api/tools` · `GET /api/tool-calls/:id` | Available tools / tool-call history. |
| `POST /api/accounting` | Double-entry accounting (bundled plugin). |

**Config, sound & misc**

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| `GET\|POST /api/config` | User UI config (`cwdPresets`, `soundFile`, `soundKinds`, `sounds`, `prRepos`, `launchers`, `quickCommands`, `userMcpServers`, `providers`). |
| `GET /api/files/panel/:id/page` · `POST /api/files/browse/panel?cwd=&path=` | A declared [file panel](docs/file-panels.md): its page, served under `default-src 'none'` and `sandbox allow-scripts`; and the page's question, `{ panel, payload }` → `{ ok, result }` with whatever JSON the panel's command printed, or `502` with why it printed none. Both look the panel up by id — neither takes a path or a command from the request. |
| `GET /api/sound?kind=` · `/api/dir-sound?cwd=&kind=` · `/api/sound-preset/:id` · `/api/dir-config?cwd=` | Custom / per-directory / preset attention sound + per-dir config. `kind` selects a config entry, never a path. |
| `PUT /api/dir-config` | The Settings form's save: `{ cwd, set: { key: value }, unset: [key] }` for the keys the form edits (`common/dirConfigForm.ts`), each validated like the Files pane's editor. Other keys and their order are kept; a file that isn't a JSON object answers 422 and is not written. Answers with the new `dir-config-detail`. |
| `GET /api/dir-config-detail?cwd=` | The same per-dir config, **plus** the settings a running terminal doesn't need (`provider`, `model`, `skills`, `addDirs`, header button/chip **labels**), **plus** which keys the file set and how each fared (applied / dropped in validation / not a setting at all). Read-only; backs the Settings modal's **Directory settings** preview. Unlike the other `?cwd=` routes this one does **not** fall back to the default workspace — it reports on the directory it was asked about, so a path that no longer exists comes back as `exists:false`. Sound paths and button commands stay server-side. |
| `GET /api/launch-options` | The Anthropic-compatible backends this server can reach, each with its models and — when it can't — the reason. Reports the **name** of the env var a key is read from, never the key. |
| `GET /api/update-status` | What is running and whether anything newer exists: `install` (`npm` / `git`), `version`, `commit` (a checkout's short HEAD sha), `latest` (npm, only when newer) and the one-line `notice`. Backs the header's **Update** badge and the Settings version line. Served from memory, recomputed at startup and every 3 hours — a long-running server started with `npx mulmoterminal@latest` is current when it starts, so only a later check can tell it a release shipped. `ready` is false until the first check lands. |
| `GET /api/notifications`(`/history`) · `POST /api/notifications/:id/clear` | Notification feed. |
| `POST /api/transcribe`(`/model`…) | Voice-input transcription (Whisper, macOS). |
| `POST /api/translation` | Runtime UI-string translation. |
| `GET /api/remote-host/status` · `POST /api/remote-host/{connect,disconnect}` | Companion phone-client link. Each response carries the command channel's `health` (`online` / `reconnecting` / `offline`, plus the last listener error), so the toolbar shows a dropped channel instead of the last state it happened to fetch. |
| `POST /api/open-dir` · `POST /api/pick-file` | Reveal a dir in Finder/Explorer; OS file-picker → path (`{ directory: true }` opens the folder picker — used by the launcher's Working-directory 📁 button). Both run on the SERVER's machine, and both answer **500 with a reason** when it has nothing to open a dialog with, rather than a silent nothing (#1447). The picker tries every dialog the host might have: macOS `osascript`, Windows PowerShell, **WSL** the Windows dialog over interop (`powershell.exe` + `wslpath`), Linux `zenity` → `kdialog` → `qarma` → `yad`. A user cancel is a 200 with `paths: []`. |
| `POST /api/session/:id/drop` | A dropped file whose path the browser withheld. **Raw bytes**, not JSON, under the file's own content type (base64 in JSON would cap real files near 18 MB, and a dropped `.json` would be parsed as a document); the original name rides percent-encoded in `x-drop-filename` and is used for its **suffix only**. Answers `{ path }` — absolute, inside the private per-session directory the session was granted at launch. 110 MiB cap; 404 for a session this server isn't running. |

The phone itself uses **none** of these routes — it reaches the host over Firestore command
docs, not HTTP. Every command it can send, and the shapes it gets back, are in
[`docs/remote-host-protocol.md`](docs/remote-host-protocol.md).

### WebSocket: `/ws` (terminal)

A raw WebSocket carrying the terminal stream for one session. One PTY per
connection (or reattach to an existing background PTY).

**Connect**

- `ws://host/ws` — start a **new** session (server generates a UUID and spawns
  `claude --session-id <uuid> --settings <hooks>`).
- `ws://host/ws?session=<id>` — **resume/reattach** a session. If a live
  background PTY exists for `<id>`, the socket reattaches to it (and its recent
  output buffer is replayed); otherwise the server spawns
  `claude --resume <id> --settings <hooks>`.
- `&cols=<n>&rows=<n>` — the terminal's geometry, on every endpoint that starts a PTY. The
  PTY is created at it instead of the 120x30 default, so nothing is ever drawn at a size the
  browser didn't ask for. Out-of-range values are ignored (same bounds as a `resize` frame),
  and a connection that sends none keeps the default until its first `resize`.

**Server → client** (JSON text frames):

| Message | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| `{ "type": "session", "id": string }` | Sent immediately on connect — the session id this socket is bound to (lets the client learn a new session's generated id). |
| `{ "type": "output", "data": string }` | PTY output to write to the terminal. On reattach, the first `output` frame is the replayed tail buffer (≤ 64 KB). |
| `{ "type": "exit", "exitCode": number, "signal": number }` | The `claude` process exited; the socket then closes. |
| `{ "type": "paneMode", "inCopyMode": boolean }` | tmux-backed sessions only: whether the pane is in tmux copy-mode, where keys go to tmux instead of the program. Sent when it changes, and again to a reattached socket. |

**Client → server** (JSON text frames):

| Message | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| `{ "type": "input", "data": string }` | Keystrokes / bytes to write to the PTY. |
| `{ "type": "resize", "cols": number, "rows": number }` | Resize the PTY. |
| `{ "type": "exitCopyMode" }` | tmux-backed sessions only: leave copy-mode (`send-keys -X cancel`). Writes nothing to the PTY. |

A non-JSON frame is written to the PTY verbatim (fallback).

**Disconnect** — when the socket closes, if Claude is still `working` the PTY is
**kept alive** in the background; otherwise it's killed. See
[Session lifecycle](#session-lifecycle).

### More WebSocket endpoints

The other raw WebSockets share the `/ws` frame format (`output` / `input` / `resize` / `exit`, plus
`paneMode` / `exitCopyMode` for a tmux-backed session).
**Every non-Claude agent has one** — `/ws/codex`, `/ws/antigravity`, `/ws/grok`, `/ws/muse`,
`/ws/copilot`, `/ws/cursor` — and they take the same query and behave the same way; codex's is
documented here as the representative one, and the per-agent differences are the matrix in
[`docs/agent-capability-matrix.md`](docs/agent-capability-matrix.md).

- **`/ws/codex?session=<id>&cwd=<dir>&gui=<0|1>`** — a **Codex** agent PTY. Like `/ws` it sends a `session` frame
  with the id and reattaches to a live or tmux-backed session on resume. `gui=0` (grid
  cells) omits the GUI MCP and marks the session a grid terminal.
- **`/ws/launch?session=<id>&cwd=<dir>&launcher=<index>`** — a **launch command** PTY (a
  plain shell, `codex`, or any command configured in Settings → Launch commands). Unlike a
  Run-menu script it's **persistent and reattachable** (survives page switches /
  reconnects), but it reports no activity of its own, so its dot only shows running vs. exited.

### WebSocket: `/ws/run` (command terminal)

A raw WebSocket carrying a one-off **Run-menu command** (see
[Scripts (Run menu)](#scripts-run-menu)) — a plain shell PTY, **not** a Claude
session, so there's no `session` message, no hooks, and no reattach.

**Connect**

- `ws://host/ws/run?index=<n>&cwd=<dir>` — run the script at position `<n>` in
  `<dir>/script.json` (cwd falls back to `CLAUDE_CWD`). The server reads that
  file and spawns `$SHELL -lc "<command>"` in the script's `cwd`. An out-of-range
  index (or a missing/invalid `script.json`) yields
  `{ "type": "error", "message": string }` and the socket closes.

The **output / input / resize / exit** frames are identical to `/ws`. There is no
`session` frame.

**Disconnect** — the terminal is **ephemeral**: when the socket closes (cell
closed, or page reloaded) the process is **killed**. There is no background
survival and no resume.

### Socket.IO: `/ws/pubsub` (activity pub/sub)

A minimal Socket.IO pub/sub for live session-activity updates. Channel names are
Socket.IO rooms.

- **Path**: `/ws/pubsub`, transport: `websocket`.
- **Client → server events**:
  - `subscribe` with a channel name (string) → join the room.
  - `unsubscribe` with a channel name (string) → leave the room.
- **Server → client event**: `data` with `{ channel: string, data: <payload> }`.

**Channel `"sessions"`** — payloads describe a single session change:

```jsonc
// activity change (working/waiting flipped)
{ "id": "d16f43f3-...", "working": false, "waiting": true, "event": "Stop" }

// a brand-new session was created
{ "id": "…", "working": false, "event": "created" }

// a session's PTY was closed/reaped
{ "id": "…", "working": false, "event": "closed" }
```

`event` is the originating hook (`UserPromptSubmit` | `Stop` | `Notification`) or
a lifecycle marker (`created` | `closed` | `null`). The client treats **any**
`sessions` message as a signal to refetch `GET /api/sessions` (the server is the
single source of truth for the list), so payload details are advisory.

---

## Session model

Per-session state lives on the server (`activity` map) and is surfaced as two
booleans on every session record:

| Flag      | Set when | Cleared when | UI |
| --------- | -------- | ------------ | -- |
| `working` | `UserPromptSubmit` hook fires (Claude started a turn) | `Stop` hook fires (turn finished) | **Blue dot** next to the title |
| `waiting` | A **background** session fires `Notification` (waiting for input — permission / question / idle) **or** `Stop` (finished, output unseen, ready for another message) | The session is brought to the **foreground** (a WebSocket attaches to it) | **Bold** title |

"Foreground" = a session that currently has an attached terminal WebSocket (the
one you're viewing). `waiting` is only ever set for **background** sessions,
because a foreground session is already on screen.

            ┌───────── working? ──────────┐
           yes                            no
            │                             │
   keep PTY alive (background)        kill PTY (reap), publish "closed"
            │
   Stop hook in background:
   waiting=true (bold), working=false, reap PTY
   (flag persists via on-disk record → stays listed & bold until viewed)
```

Key rules:

- **Switching away never interrupts Claude mid-turn** — a `working` session's PTY
  survives in the background.
- A background session that goes **idle** (`Stop`) is **reaped** (killed). If it
  finished with unseen output, its `waiting` flag persists via the on-disk
  session record, so it stays listed and **bold** until you open it.
- **Reattach over respawn**: selecting a session that still has a live background
  PTY reattaches to it (replaying a ≤ 64 KB output tail) instead of spawning a
  duplicate `claude`.
- **One live viewer per session**: a session is bound to a single socket. Opening
  it in a second place (another tab, or another grid cell pointed at the same dir)
  reattaches there and **supersedes** the first, which detaches. So a launcher's
  resume list **refuses** a session that is open anywhere (`● open`) rather than
  offering to take it over — and the server answers "anywhere" from its own PTY
  table plus tmux, so another browser tab and a second `mulmoterminal` process
  count too.
- Brand-new sessions are listed **immediately** (before their `.jsonl`
  exists) via the in-memory `knownSessions` registry + a `created` push; an
  unused one disappears when its PTY is reaped.
- **Background workers get their own filter.** A session nobody started by hand —
  a collection's scheduled refresh, a **user scheduled task** (the dev worklog and
  anything else the scheduler runs), or a plugin's `spawnBackgroundChat`
  `hidden: true` — is listed under the **Background** chip instead of among the
  chats, so a refresh schedule doesn't fill the history. It stays openable (a
  MulmoTerminal session is a live terminal, so a row you can't reach is a process
  you can't stop), and it is put on the same count+age retention as the
  scheduler's own sessions. The chip appears only when there is one to show. A
  **manual** collection Refresh is a normal visible session — unchanged. The
  marking is persisted (`~/.mulmoterminal/background-sessions.json`), so a worker
  stays out of the chat list after it finishes and after a restart.

---

## Claude hook injection

Activity is detected via Claude Code hooks injected **per spawn**, without
touching the user's `~/.claude/settings.json` or project settings. The server
passes `claude --settings '<json>'` where the JSON registers a command hook for
`UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, and `Notification`, each of which pipes the hook
payload to the server:

```jsonc
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "curl -s -X POST http://localhost:$PORT/api/hook -H 'content-type: application/json' -d @-" }] }],
    "Stop":             [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "curl … -d @-" }] }],
    "Notification":     [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "curl … -d @-" }] }]
  }
}
```

Because the server spawns each new session with `--session-id <uuid>`, it always
knows the live session's id — even before the session's `.jsonl` file exists.

---

## Closing summary

Every Claude session is spawned with `claude --append-system-prompt '<text>'`, asking the
agent to end a reply with a short summary **when it hands control back** — the work is
finished, or it is stopping to ask a question. Coming back to a grid cell after a while, the
standing request and what came of it are otherwise only recoverable by scrolling the whole
session.

The summary states three things: the request **for the conversation as a whole** (not the
last message — several turns of refinement do not replace what was asked first), what was
achieved, and what was not and why. It is written in the language of the conversation, and
placed last with nothing after it.

It is deliberately **not** written on every turn: mid-work replies and short factual answers
carry no standing request, and a summary that always appears stops being read. The wording
lives in `server/agents/session-summary-prompt.ts`.

**On by default, and switchable off** with `appendSystemPrompt: false` — in
`~/.mulmoterminal/config.json`, or in a directory's `.mulmoterminal.json`, which outranks the
global value. Read per spawn, so no restart is needed; a session already running keeps what it
was launched with. Nothing in the app parses what the summary says, so turning it off costs no
feature — the roster and push notifications simply show the raw tail of the reply.

Which sections `--append-system-prompt` ends up carrying is decided in
`server/agents/appended-prompt.ts`: this one and the `prWorkdirFooter` clone line are separate
settings on the same flag, and with both off the flag is not passed at all.

Codex sessions are unaffected — the CLI has no equivalent flag.

---

## Session discovery & titles

Claude stores each project's sessions as JSONL files under
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl` (under `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` instead of `~/.claude` when that is set), where the absolute `cwd`
has its `/` and `.` characters replaced with `-` (e.g.
`/Users/you/proj` → `-Users-you-proj`).

A session's display **title** is derived by scanning its JSONL for, in order of
preference:

1. the **session note** the user wrote (see below),
2. else a live **AI title** the server generated for the session this run (see below),
3. else the latest `ai-title` record's `aiTitle` (e.g. written by MulmoClaude),
4. else the latest `last-prompt` record's `lastPrompt`,
5. else the first real user message (slash/local-command wrappers like
   `<local-command-…>` are skipped),
6. else `"(untitled session)"`.

In-memory sessions not yet persisted show as `"New session"` until their file
appears, at which point the on-disk title takes over.

### AI header title

The raw last prompt is a poor cell-header label once a session becomes a
back-and-forth: a follow-up is either a trivial ack (`ok`, `はい` — skipped, so the
header keeps showing the now-stale opening task) or context-dependent (`2番目にして`
— meaningless on its own). So the header shows a short **AI title** instead, falling back
to the last prompt when there is none yet.

By default that title is **read, not generated**: Claude Code writes an `ai-title` record
into its own transcript, and the server picks it up from the pass it already makes over
that file. Nothing is spawned, so nothing has to be given tools — the previous behaviour
launched a full `claude -p` session per title, and one of those ran `git push origin main`
in a working repository (#1769). The cost is freshness: Claude's own title is written once
per session and never revised, so it describes what the session STARTED as. Set
`MT_TITLE_SOURCE=headless` to go back to summarizing the recent turns with a cheap model
(`MT_TITLE_MODEL`, default `haiku`), which does follow a drifting topic.

Either way the title is refreshed on the same schedule — at a turn's `Stop` (when the reply
is on disk) and only when one is **due**: none yet, the newest prompt was a
trivial/context-dependent ack (so the raw last prompt would be stale), or every few turns.
The cadence matters much less now that the default source costs nothing to read. The title
this server is showing lives in memory (this repo never writes `ai-title` lines into Claude's
own transcript); a resumed session falls back to the on-disk `ai-title` directly.

### Session note

Every tier above says what the **agent** said, which stops answering "which cell is this?"
once several sessions are open. So a cell header also takes a **note you write yourself**: the
pencil button beside the header text opens a one-line box (Enter saves, Esc cancels, clicking
away saves). While a note is set it *replaces* the header line — the title it displaced stays in
the tooltip — and it becomes the session's title in the launcher's session list and on the phone's roster
too, so one session goes by one name everywhere.

Notes are capped at 200 characters and folded to a single line. They are stored per **session
id** in `~/.mulmoterminal/session-memos.jsonl` and survive both the session being reaped and a
server restart: resume the session and the note comes back. Saving one publishes it on the
`sessions` channel, so every other open tab and the phone update without asking.

`POST /api/session/:id/memo` with `{ "text": "…" }` writes one; an empty `text` erases it. The
route answers with the **stored** text, which is what a reload will show.

## Testing

```bash
yarn test
```

`test/src/components/` covers the roster and the launcher's session list:
`CockpitHeader.spec.ts`, `rosterPhase.spec.ts` and `rosterAlertClasses.spec.ts` for
what a row shows, `CellLaunchForm.spec.ts` for resuming one. The pub/sub composable
and `fetch` are mocked so the tests run without a server.

Satoshi was the software architect for **Windows 95**, **Windows 98** and **Internet Explorer
3.0 / 4.0** at Microsoft, later founded UIEvolution / Xevo, and still builds from Seattle.

The two have shipped open source together since 2015, and the core of each venture has been
public every time:

MulmoTerminal is the seventh.

It exists because we run several coding agents every day and kept losing track of which one was
waiting on us. Everything here was built for that, then kept because it worked. MIT licensed.

## Contributing

**Please open an issue rather than a pull request.** Bug reports and feature requests are very
welcome and are the way a change gets in; outside pull requests are closed automatically,
whatever their size.

Writing code stopped being the bottleneck — reading it did not, and a large generated diff is
hard to audit for a reviewer who did not help shape the design. This app runs coding agents
against your real machine and repositories, so we do not merge what we cannot fully review.
What is scarce instead is the bug we cannot reach from here and the idea we have not had.

The full policy, the issue-writing rules and the automated triage: **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**
(bilingual).
