// The application shell, and by now almost nothing: the grid IS the app, and the full-screen

// PAGE rather than to any view — a launch request arriving from the phone, the attention sound,
// the favicon, the close guard.
//
// The single terminal view lived here until #1202. Everything it owned has a home in the grid: the
// settings modal (GridView's own), the tools and Canvas panes (beside a zoomed cell), the session
// list (the cockpit roster, and the launcher's resume list for sessions off the grid), and the
// content surfaces (the Collections door in the toolbar). What it uniquely had — one terminal
// filling the window — is a zoomed cell.
