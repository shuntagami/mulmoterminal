// Three cell types render in the same grid — a Claude session, a script run, a configured
// launcher — and GridView drives all three identically: it expands one, reorders them, and
// sorts by the attention each reports. That contract belongs to the GRID, not to any cell,
// and it was written out three times with the same comments attached (#646 B1).
//
// Named once so a fourth cell type gets it by construction rather than by copying, and so a
// change to what the grid needs cannot land in two of the three.

// The pane showing beside the ENLARGED cell. One slot, three possible occupants, never two at
// once — the row is already `roster | terminal | pane`, and a fourth column leaves the terminal
// unreadable on a laptop. Declared with the rest of the grid's contract because every cell type
// renders the toggles and none of them owns the state.
//
// A LIST the type is derived from, not a union spelled out on its own (the shape
// common/sessionAgent.ts uses): the grid also validates a pane read back from localStorage, and
// while that guard was its own hand-written list, a pane could be added to the union, wired end to
// end, and still fail to reopen after a reload — with nothing failing to say so (CodeRabbit,
// #1749). Adding a member here now reaches the guard by construction.
