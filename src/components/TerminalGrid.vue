// case refuses to do, so it gives up instead. Caught by Codex on PR #1227.

// for by a click. The flush is a network save, and the files pane stays mounted while the grid is

// away from its own preconditions by the time it lands — the user may have zoomed a cell by hand or
// walked off to an overlay in between, and taking the screen back then is precisely the takeover
// this path exists to avoid. Re-asked AFTER the await, so it sees the world the enlargement would
// actually happen in. A click passes nothing: "bring that cell here" survives whatever moved.
// Raised by Codex on this PR, the same race it caught in #1227.

    <!-- Cockpit roster: a tall text row per cell (status / dir / memo / summary / prompt / latest
         reply). Click a row to swap which terminal is enlarged.
         The 9px gap is 5px of visible channel plus the 2px ring every row paints on each side
         (rosterAlertClasses). At the old 5px two neighbours' rings came within a pixel of each
         other and the column read as one fused block.

         `pr-0` is deliberate, and the right gutter is on the ROWS instead (`mr-1.5`, named by every
         branch in rosterAlertClasses). The expanded row names none, so it ends flush with this
         aside's edge and butts against the splitter — the shape that says it IS the terminal beside
         it. Putting the gutter back here would reinstate the 6px of `bg-deep` that made the row
         read as a card floating near the edge, and the negative margin that used to cancel it
         silently mis-aligned the moment this padding changed. -->

           (#2001). Same mechanism either way: the cell is MOVED, never re-created, so its socket,
           its xterm and its scrollback carry across untouched. -->
      <!-- Keyed by WHERE it is going, not only by which cell it is. A `<Teleport>` that changes
           target while it is DISABLED keeps the old one, and re-enabling it later moves the cell
           into that stale node — it leaves the document and nothing brings it back (enlarging a
           chat's cell after visiting a collection lost the terminal, PR #2002). Re-keying gives the
           pane trip its own teleport; the zoom keeps the same one, so its FLIP animation still has
           the elements it measured. The cell's TERMINAL survives the remount either way: its slot
           is durable, so `attach` re-parents the same xterm rather than reconnecting. -->

<!-- The one <style> block left in the app, and a deliberate exception to CLAUDE.md's
     "utilities only" rule. Both escapes the rule offers were measured and rejected:

     * The THEME route does not work here. `cell-in` / `strip-in` are referenced from the
       descendant selectors below, not from an `animate-*` utility on an element — and Tailwind
       drops an `@theme` keyframes block that no utility mentions (verified: an unused one emits
       nothing at all). Moving them there would silently stop the FLIP cross-fade, with no error
       and no failing test.
     * The GLOBAL-STYLESHEET route needs renames to be safe. `.grid` and `.stage` are generic
       enough that `.grid` already exists in three other components, so lifting these out of
       scope invites collisions.

     What is actually being expressed is the grid's layout state machine — three modes (tiled /
     zoomed+roster / zoomed+strip) applied to `.grid > *`, which are the Teleport-ed cell
     components. This component does not own their markup, so making these utilities would mean
     handing grid-layout state to CommandCell, LauncherCell and TerminalCell individually.

     The off-screen box in list mode (`left: -99999px` at a real 900x600) is load-bearing, not
     cosmetic: it keeps the non-expanded cells mounted with a measurable size so xterm never fits
     itself to zero. See #1125. -->

   What grows is the FRAME: the cell's content (CELL_INNER) cancels this scale out about the same
