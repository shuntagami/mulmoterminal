// Out of GridView for the reason `rosterAgent` next door is: this is a pure data transformation
// over state the component happens to hold, and a row that says the wrong thing is invisible in a
// component test but obvious in a table of inputs and outputs.
//
// The four lookups are passed rather than imported because each is a DIFFERENT key: the meta is
// per session, the chrome and the phase are per directory (cells sharing a directory share one
// fetch), and the status is per cell. Handing them in as functions is what lets this stay pure
// while the caller keeps its reactive maps.

 *  This rule has now drawn three findings in one review loop (a reverse-prefix match, a shorter
 *  opening that shared a beginning, and a capped title read as a truncation it was not). Each fix
 *  banned one more shape, which is the pattern that never ends: there is always another way for two
 *  strings to look alike. So it is inverted. Exactly two cases may be suppressed, and everything
 *  else shows:
 *
 *    1. The summary IS the prompt — the same text once whitespace is collapsed. A one-turn cell,
 *       which is the state a freshly started cell sits in while it answers, and the case this
 *       whole rule exists for.
 *    2. The summary is OUR OWN truncation of the prompt — it starts it, is exactly
 *       `AGENT_TITLE_MAX` long, and came from an agent whose label IS the opening prompt. The last
 *       clause is the one round 5 found missing: copilot's and muse's titles are written by the
 *       agent, so a 200-character one that happens to begin the prompt is an independent sentence,
 *       not a cut-off copy.
 *
 *  It deliberately shows some rows that ARE near-duplicates — a paraphrase, a prompt that merely
 *  begins the same way — because that costs a line of chrome, where the other direction costs the
 *  reader a fact the row exists to carry. Claude's `aiTitle` never reaches here at all: it is a
 *  summary rather than a quote of the prompt. */
