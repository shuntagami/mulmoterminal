// toolbar, so it hangs straight off the toolbar's New terminal button, which leads the row there. It
// used to open at the right edge, across the screen from the button that opened it; where a result
// appears should say what caused it. Below the toolbar rather than full height, so the button stays
// in view, pressed, and pressing it again closes what it opened.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT A CELL: the grid has three view modes (docs/grid-view-modes.md) and a form placed
// as a cell means three different things — a tile that pushes its neighbours along in the tiled
// grid, a stolen enlarged slot while zoomed, and a roster row that is not even a TerminalCell.
// Sitting OVER the stage instead, as AppSettingsModal already does, is one behaviour in all three.
// It also keeps the form out of `state.cells`, so none of the "how many empty forms are open, and
// which one does `+` cancel" bookkeeping applies to it.
//
// This component owns only what the form edits (dir / agent / model choice) and forwards the four
// launch intents. Turning an intent into a cell is GridView's job, because only it can place one.
