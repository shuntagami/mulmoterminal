// surface owns scope and navigation.

// The project comes from the ROUTE, and null — the workspace — is what every way of opening this
// overlay still produces. Only one thing puts a project in that URL: a completion bell whose
// record lives in one (server/backends/collectionNotifierAdapter.ts). A GETTER because the stack
// is read imperatively at the moment a request is built, so the surface must answer for the page
// on screen NOW rather than for the one it was pushed on.
