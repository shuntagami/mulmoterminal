// The grid cells' shared chrome — the Claude cell (TerminalCell), the command cell, and the

// silently failed to reach a component whose template has a fragment root: Vue gives the
// parent's scope id to a single root element only (#787).

// The `cell-*` class names stay on the elements as state and query hooks. They carry no
// styling now, so the specs that select on them aren't coupled to how a cell looks.
