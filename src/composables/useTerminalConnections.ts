// ── CHANGING THE TERMINAL? UPDATE THE DOCS IN THE SAME COMMIT ─────────────────────────
// Terminal behaviour is documented in three places, and a spec that changes in code but
// not in prose leaves a reader believing something that is no longer true — which is
// exactly what happened to the file-path link routing (#834):
//   - docs/terminal-notes.md — the developer reference for this stack (xterm addons,
//     tmux passthrough, links, mouse tracking, renderer) AND its upgrade regression
//     checklist. Read it before touching xterm, an addon, tmux, or node-pty.
//   - README.md — the user-facing behaviour (keys, selection, file paths, the GUI panel).
//   - docs/guide/en/features.md + docs/guide/ja/features.md — the feature table, in BOTH
//     languages; they are meant to stay in sync.
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A module-singleton manager that owns each terminal's durable runtime — its
// WebSocket, xterm instance, reconnect/backoff state — independent of the Vue
// component lifecycle. This is what lets a session's PTY stay alive (and its
// socket stay open) while its Terminal.vue is unmounted: navigating away, flipping
// to an off-page grid tab, or toggling Grid<->single only DETACHES the view (the
// xterm's host element is re-parented out of the DOM), it does not close the socket.
//
// Why this matters: the server keeps a PTY alive for exactly as long as its
// WebSocket is open (it only arms the reap grace timer on socket close). So holding
// the socket open here means coming back reattaches an already-live session — no
// `claude --resume`, no "restoring session" token cost — instead of a cold resume.
//
// Each terminal "slot" is addressed by a stable key: the grid cell's uid
// (`cell-<uid>`), the single view's `single`, or an ephemeral id for command/Run
// terminals (which are NOT persisted — their process is unresumable, so their slot
// is released on unmount like before).

// outlives every component, which is exactly the lifetime the watch wants.
