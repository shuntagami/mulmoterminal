// Talking to a conversation room from the browser (#1456).
//
// Thin on purpose: the interesting decisions — what a window is, how a room reads to an agent —
// are pure and live in `common/roomMessage.ts`, so both this and the server render the same thing.
//
// Each operation comes in two forms, and the pair is the point. The `load*` / `send*` form answers
// whether it worked; the `fetch*` / `post*` form throws that answer away. Both are wanted, by
// different callers: the round-table runner is mid-conversation and must not stop because one
// request dropped, while a person watching a room must not be shown an empty conversation when the
// truth is "could not read it". One HTTP call site, two policies, neither hidden inside the other.
