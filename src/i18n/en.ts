// The Settings modal, the STATUS WORDS the grid and the roster show (#2182), the terminal's
// copy-mode banner (#2207), the launch form's notice for an agent that cannot start (#2230), and the
// PRs & Issues view's agent picker for starting issue work (#2226), and the hover tips and
// aria-labels, surface by surface (`tips`, #2408). The rest of the app — the visible words of the
// panes, the header's buttons and chips — is still hardcoded English and moves surface by surface
// (#1566): a half-migrated tree with no rule about what is in it is worse than a small one with a
// stated edge.
//
// `groups.*` and `tabs.*` are keyed by the ids in components/settings/settingsTabs.ts, which is why
// that table holds no words. A spec pins that every id there has a message here and in every other
// locale.
