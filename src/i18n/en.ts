// The Settings modal's words, in English. This is the fallback bundle, so a key another locale has
// not translated yet renders these words rather than the key itself.
//
// The Settings modal, the STATUS WORDS the grid and the roster show (#2182), the terminal's
// copy-mode banner (#2207), the launch form's notice for an agent that cannot start (#2230), and the
// PRs & Issues view's agent picker for starting issue work (#2226). The rest of the
// app is still hardcoded English and moves surface by surface (#1566) — a half-migrated tree with
// no rule about what is in it is worse than a small one with a stated edge. The next surfaces are
// the header's buttons and chips, then the panes.
//
// `groups.*` and `tabs.*` are keyed by the ids in components/settings/settingsTabs.ts, which is why
// that table holds no words. A spec pins that every id there has a message here and in every other
// locale.
