// Take a preset at its word about WHICH rules to run, and overrule it on how much they matter: a
// warning does not fail CI, so a rule left at warn is a rule that reports a violation and ships it.
// This repo has the receipt — `max-params` sat at warn behind a note saying to raise it once its one
// offender was resolved, the offender was resolved, nobody raised it, and two new violations arrived
// in the shadow of the note (#1682). Warn is for a human reading output; nothing here reads output.
//
// Written as a transform rather than a list of rule names because the list is what rots: a preset
// that adds a warn-level rule in some future release arrives already enforced, instead of silently
// re-opening the gap this closes. Severity only — the preset's own options are preserved, and a rule
// it ships as `off` stays off (it chose not to run it, which is a different decision).
//
// A rule that genuinely must not fail the build gets turned off, by name, with the reason, in one of
// the blocks below. Warn is the state in between, and it does not survive contact with time: it is
